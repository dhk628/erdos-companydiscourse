# erdos-companydiscourse
Traditional methods leverage frequency based metrics to get signal about a companyâ€™s discourse online. In this project we are going to leverage alternative features to develop a dashboard that enables companies to monitor and analyze the sentiment surrounding their brand, products, and services across various online channels.
## Project Description 
This project involves scraping Google Reviews/Reddit Threads [(using praw)](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html), vectorizing the review comments using Sentence-BERT [(SBERT)](https://sbert.net/), and then building machine learning models to predict the rating on predefined queries. The goal is to classify and evaluate reviews on the basis of product quality, price, and service.
