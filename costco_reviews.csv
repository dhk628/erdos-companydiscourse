Orbitgroover,7 years ago,5,"The scientists at University of California Davis. They tested a series of alleged extra virgin olive oils and except for boutique oils, this was the only one that was real. Remember the cover business Don Corleone was in? Olive oil import. Google the UCD test results. Sadly I didn't see this product at the store this week. I hope Costco didn't discontinue it. Costco is famous for doing that. "
Sally Sue,3 years ago,5,"One time a bunch of years ago I took the time to research olive oil and discovered that American olive oil is the best to get because imported olive oil can have anything in it, adulterants, but American olive oil has to be true to the label. I don't remember exactly my research, I think possibly other countries do put other stuff in their olive oil. Anyway I remember that American was the best quality and the Costco brand was the best price and quality there was. I don't actually remember my research but I remember that I picked Costco brand of all the brands in the whole wide world. "
FormerK,7 years ago,5,I have purchased this several times.  It is light is flavor. 
Lady Jet,7 years ago,5,I only buy this brand of Organic Olive Oil.  It is the BEST. 
David D,3 years ago,5,"We used this olive for cooking purposes and occasionally also used it for salads, and we've ordered it several times as well as purchased in-store. To our palette, it seems like a high-quality olive oil, but we're no experts. That said, we'd absolutely buy again. For shipping, Costco typically puts some extra tape around the cap to ensure it doesn't open. We've never had any issue, and the bottles are quite durable and so do not expect any future issues. (One other olive oil we ordered online was in a metal tin. While that olive oil didn't leak, the tin was definitely banged up, so we're likely sticking with the Kirkland olive oils in the plastic containers for all future shipping orders.) "
Lana,2 years ago,5,"Very happy with the Kirkland Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  What I am NOT happy with is that the oil came in a large box with no packing material. How it came without being cracked is a mystery. At the same time I had ordered the Kirkland cat food with free shipping.  I was charged extra shipping cost for the oil due to a fast delivery per Costco however, it was delivered the same time as the cat food .  Why was I charged for the oil shipping?   Also, the cat food also did not have any packing material in the box.  It came with a busted bag with spilled out cat food.  What is going on??? "
Bonzo7,2 years ago,5,I can count on Costco to have the best quality olive oil 
Grace,2 years ago,5,"Like that it’s organic it has a good flavor glad that you have been adding more organic products in your warehouse.   One big issue on this product however the cap is not secure does not close properly, also the last order I made on line who ever packed the two bottle's this last time,  did not seal themselves  with a tape they usually do when it’s shipped out even though it was in a plastic bag I could feel that the oil had slipped through the cap.  I hope you bring it to someone’s attention in the packing department, they need to be careful and consistent.  As you know I buy this product all year round.  But certain items need more attention then others when shipping. BTW FedEx does a good job notifying me when my package is delivered, UPS use to not anymore. "
HJones,2 years ago,1,"Reluctant to assign a number review because the product is its usual 5 stars, but BOTH bottles arrived with the tops permanently crushed in. They weren’t leaking so I didn’t try to have them replaced (although they pour messily now). Apparently, they changed the way they’re packed: they used to wrap the tops in heavy tape. Now they don’t and since the box itself was crushed on one side the tops were smashed in. I’ve tried to in-crush the tops but they won’t budge. So…product = 5 stars, packaging = MINUS 5 stars! "
Mitch,3 years ago,5,"We received our shipped order of olive oil with the pouring head jammed down into  the bottle, so that we could not use the original bottle at all.  This wonderful product is a great staple in our house, so we use it practically every day. This is simply a Costco packaging problem. We have received this product by shipment before from Costco, with no damage. If this is a product that can't consistently be shipped successfully by Costco,  perhaps options need to be reconsidered. "
Holly,2 years ago,5,"This is my favorite olive oil. Great quality, price and bang for you buck! "
gran,6 years ago,5,This is the EVOO rated highest by the trustiest Consumers Lab . 
Patty,2 years ago,5,This is my favorite everyday cooking oil 
Dwest,2 years ago,5,"I love this organic olive oil, it adds wonderful flavor to many dishes. I couldn’t find it in my local Costco and I hope they are not discontinuing this product. It has been a must have ingredient in a lot of my dishes. I use it with garlic and onions as a base for my rice and beans, sautéed spinach, Italian gravy, my eggs in the morning and so much more. I stocked up for a few months, but I hope they do not discontinue this item I will be very disappointed. "
Barbara Uriarte,2 years ago,5,Excellent taste and price. 
OneMan,7 years ago,1,"Don't know what happened but my new bottle that expires in over a year is very bitter. Horrible, do not buy! "
TVwatcher24,3 years ago,5,I love this olive oil for all of my everyday cooking which really means I cook everyday! It is not too heavily flavored for most kitchen needs. I have olive oil from Italy from my brother in laws family which is very special and used only for salads or eating with crudite or drizzling on already cooked foods. The Kirkland EVOO is a real workhorse in my kitchen and a great value! 5 stars for sure! 
Joanne,4 years ago,5,"For several years, I have appreciated Kirkland Signature Extra Virgin Olive Oil and used it for everything where oil is needed.  Imagine my delight when I was shopping for more and discovered it now also comes in an organic form.  I choose to buy organic as much as possible and am so pleased to find this product  The taste, texture, and even the price could not be better!. "
costcoshopper,2 years ago,5,"This extra virgin olive oil consistently tastes great, it’s consistently priced and the bottle is perfectly sized, in that it’s large enough that one isn’t constantly needing to replace it, and also not needing to decant it or try to cook while wielding a gallon size jug. It’s wonderful that it’s also conveniently available by mail. Will definitely purchase again. "
Redd,6 years ago,5,While this oil may not rank in flavor with some of the best oils that come from Sicily those oils be well over $100 for a liter. For being extra virgin and the first cold pressing this oil is a bargain for everyday use. It has a very pleasant flavor and is not bitter. I actually love this oil better than many more expensive oils I have tried. 
Anonymous,4 years ago,5,"We trust Costco’s quality, so we tried the Kirkland organic virgin olive oil and loved it. It is such a wonderful additive if you put it on vegetables, poultry, meat or anything else and gives it such an awesome taste and looks appealing also because it makes your dish look fresh without looking oily.  Thanks for another great product! "
Eliza H,4 years ago,5,"Because I go through lots of olive oil, I'm grateful to have access to this bargain-priced oil.  Though it doesn't have the peppery or grassy flavor of fancy olive oils, it's plenty good enough for cooking and is adequate for salad dressings, etc.  For dipping bread, obviously you'd choose one with a more distinctive flavor. "
DeniD,2 years ago,5,"I almost exclusively use olive oil for cooking, and I have found this Kirkland brand to be an excellent choice. It has a lovely, deep olive flavor and a little burn at the end, just like it's supposed to do. I used to pay four times as much for another brand, but I can discern no difference in quality between the two. "
Nancy,4 years ago,5,"Excellent oil and a great price. The experts claim that much of the olive oil sold in the USA is either adulterated or has no olive oil in it at all. It's really a big issue. I trust Kirkland's olive oil to actually be EVOO. I use it for everything. Some pasta, a little salt and pepper and this oil are all you need. "
Sally,3 years ago,5,"This is an excellent olive oil for daily use, for cooking, marinades, salad dressings. I reserve one special bottle of olive oil for dishes where a top-up of flavor is warranted, or, for special salads. The Costco oil is perfect for all my other daily cooking and seasoning needs. Great product at a fair price. "
NMTom,4 years ago,5,"Nice taste in salad dressing and other non-heated uses.  Because of the low heat point of extra virgin olive oil, I switch to other olive oils or avocado oil for cooking, regardless of what is said in the recipe.  Good shelf life.  My previous purchase was a year ago and the taste is the same as my new bottle. "
JcLez,3 years ago,5,"I consume this olive oil in all my meals. and my focus is on nutrition. For instance, per my Carb Manager App. one tablespoon serving of this oil contains about zero net carbs, about 14 grams of unsaturated fat, zero cholesterol and a great total of 118 calories (it also has about 2.0 grams of Saturated fat). "
BattleBots,5 years ago,5,"I love this olive oil, it's one of the best I've ever had.  Unlike many of the oils sold in stores claiming to be extra virgin, this Kirkland olive oil meets all the requirements.  It's imported from Italy and I love the flavor.  And it comes in a 2-L bottle at a reasonable price.  What are you waiting for? "
Papa,4 years ago,5,"In the old country, as a young boy, I helped my grandfather harvest his olive trees, then take the olives tug o the grindstone to grind the olives. Kirkland Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil, has the closest fresh olive oil taste of fresh ground olives of my grandfathers orchard. Keep up the good work, Costco. "
zevsmom,4 years ago,5,"We use KIRKLAND ORGANIC Virgin Olive Oil daily and have for years. I trust Costco brands to use reliable sources, which relieves me of concerns that I have had with other virgin olive oils which might be mixed with lesser quality oils. We mix OVOO with crushed garlic and use it happily in cooking. "
Tatiana,3 years ago,1,"I’m sure this product would have been great, but it arrived only with some white plumbers tape wrapped around the cap(it looked like). There was no safety seal on the internal cap, it was just open. Not usable. Sad, now still need olive oil. Not sure whether it’s safe to order this again online "
Antonina Wiser,4 years ago,5,"I bought this product after reading reviews on the best real olive oil, to my surprise Kirkland was listed with the top five 100% pure virgins olive oils.  I told the manager of my store and said, they should put this on the end isles showing the worst and best olive oil. Thank you Kirkland "
Taka,2 years ago,4,"Good oil, one star deduction was due to flaw of pull-top design. The plastic pull-top rings were easily broken. So I had to use plyer to grab the rings and pull it hard. Without a tool, it is impossible to open it by fingers.  This happened before and the pull-top design should be improved. "
JonV,4 years ago,5,Good quality EVOO for the price.  It is organic as well.  The packing for shipping was a little suspect when it came in where the top of the bottle was pushed in.  Popped it back out. There was extra seal tape on it as well so limited leakage issues.  Save a trip to Costco for one item. 
ART US ARTIST,3 years ago,5,"Kirkland Signature Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 2 L: Essential ingredient, delicious, nutritious, natural vitamins in every meal. Kirkland Signature Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 2 L, is indispensable, and we enjoy it, every day for a very happy healthy life for the entire family. "
Anonymous,4 years ago,3,"I'm not sure if Costco had to change suppliers during Covid, but it seems that this is different olive oil than they used to sell.  The taste is very, very strong, almost rancid.  I'm using it as body oil now because the taste just seems off to me.  That said, my skin is very smooth. "
SFjohn,4 years ago,1,I was hoping to buy Bell’.Olio Extra Light Tasting Olive Oil which was available at our local Costco. It wasn’t available online so we bought this. If you are looking for an extra dark oil with a super heavy OLIVE taste you will like this. We found it revolting and gave it away... 
eastend,2 years ago,5,"Over the past two decades, I’ve lived in Italy for near three years total, and I miss the wonderful produce and groceries easily available there. Is the Kirkland EVO the BEST oil ever? No. But for the price, it is exceptional. I happily use it extensively in cooking and salads. "
JNDC,4 years ago,5,"Excellent EVOO. I used to use Fillipo Berrio (sp?) but this is richer and fuller in flavor, and it's organic. I have started to buy it in this smaller size (2L) to ensure it staying fresh and stable. Have never been disappointed in a Kirkland product and this is no exception. "
masheeran,2 years ago,5,"Exceptional  product and price. I've been using this olive oil for a year and 1/2 for cooking, salad dressings...everything. Thanks Costco!!!ps.  I live 3 hours from the nearest Costco so I appreciate having the ability to order itemss and have them shipped to my home!!! "
Mary,2 years ago,5,"I'm not an olive oil lover but have read good things about the health benefits and the quality of this brand.  I've been pleasantly surprised I've been able to add it into my food preparation and be okay with the taste, which is to say it is not too pungent or over whelming. "
Maggie T,3 years ago,5,We want to use good quality cooking oil because it is consumed almost every day. This is the one our family consistently buy. It is organic and extra virgin. The dark-color bottle keeps the oil from oxidation. The amount is not too large so that we can always use fresh oil. 
Ruth,3 years ago,5,"Great every day olive oil, good for cooking or salads....I'm a health but and go through a lot of olive oil.  I try to keep my super good stuff for salads... but honestly this stuff is so good no one can tell the difference.   It's great value and easy to use bottle. "
Kelly Koz,4 years ago,5,"I’ve been buying this for years in store. Recently ordering online. Has nothing to do with quality of product, but Costco could package better when shipping, to avoid receiving with top squished. Otherwise, a great product at great price I will continue purchasing. "
Mark,3 years ago,5,"I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS. EXCELLENT QUALITY AND A GREAT VALUE.  IT IS LIGHT, CLEAR, SAVORY, BUT NOT OVER WHELMING.  I USE IT FOR SALADS. GREEN SALADS, VEGETABLE SALADS, CHICKEN SALAD, TUNA SALAD, AND EVEN FRESH BAKED BREAD INSTEAD OF BUTTER OR MARGARINE. "
mtngrrl,5 years ago,3,"This is a reliably good, work-horse olive oil perfect for sauteing, grilling and roasting. It has a fairly neutral flavor so would be appealing to those who do not like the grassy, more pungent, flavors of higher-end, finishing olive oils. I use it every day. "
ARO1,3 years ago,5,"We've been using this olive oil for years. It has good flavor and is great for cooking all kinds of things, from scrambling eggs for breakfast to cooking meats and oven-roasting vegetables for dinner. It's very affordably priced and we love that it's organic! "
Liz D,3 years ago,4,"We use this olive oil for cooking, salad dressings and anything that requires olive oil. It cooks well and doesn't add any unpleasant taste to the food. Having this large quantity bottle is very convenient. I just wish it came with a small pourer at the top. "
Lilly9,2 years ago,4,This olive oil has good flavor.  I'm picky about olive oils and this one fits my requirements.  I would only ask that the bottle not pour out so fast.  I'll have to buy an olive oil canister that pours slower and transfer it over.  Don't want to waste any. 
AMF921,2 years ago,5,I've been using the Kirkland brand of Extra Virgin Olive Oil for several years now and  like it. I tried it on a whim to try and save some money and found it was just as good as the pricier Extra Virgin Olive Oil. I will continue to use it in my kitchen. 
Lucy,3 years ago,5,I am very pleased with Kirkland's Signature Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  It is both delicious and affordable and one that I do not want to do without.  I use it for practically all of my cooking.  This oil adds flavor to all of my meals and salads. 
Jonathan H,3 years ago,5,"Great, and inexpensive.  If you do research on authentic extra virgin olive oil (as there is quite a bit of fraud) you will find this one listed as genuine by many outlets.  EVOO has a shelf life and goes rancid.  Lesser oils have a harsher flavor. "
Sharon,2 years ago,5,Best olive oil I’ve found on the market today! And I saw a UTube video of a man that tests Olive and avocado oils and he said Costcos is ALWAYS 100% what they say is in it! When you buy other brands it’s mixed with lower quality vegetable oils! 
Irishayes,4 years ago,5,"Only Kirkland could produce such a great olive oil and package it in a family sized bottle for so little.  This olive oil is perfect for everyday cooking, the fact that it is organic and cheaper than the non organic Kirkland variety is a bonus! "
AZ Mountain,2 years ago,5,"Slice a Bagett, dip one side in Kirkland olive oil, put in oven low broil on baking sheet for 5 minutes oil side up, remove and top with small slice mozzarella cheese and slice of Roma tomato. One way we use our Kirkland Olive oil. Delicious "
Maureen,4 years ago,5,"First quality oil with a rich flavor but very peppery (if you don’t like black pepper flavor, you definitely won’t like this).Better than any other olive oils I’ve tasted. This will be in my pantry for as long as they continue to offer it. "
tuna consumer,4 years ago,5,This olive oil has a good taste and is not heavy on the tongue.  Also the source of the olives (Italy) is reliable; it's not a mash up from questionable sources.  The general packaging is very nice also - protectively dark and good pouring. 
Thanson,3 years ago,5,"Really like this olive oil. Great taste and stores well. Since it’s so large, I keep it in the  pantry and keep a smaller bottle in the kitchen since  we use everyday. The only thing I would suggest is use a glass bottle instead of plastic "
Moni100,3 years ago,5,"I love this organic extra virgin olive oil!  I use is for most everything from frying to adding to recipes in place of butter and for mixing salad dressings and marinating meat, poultry and fish and adding spices.  It has never failed me. "
Beogradska,4 years ago,3,"You should know the container is plastic. Glass is so much better as an oil vessel - even aluminum (or ceramic) would be better. I find myself using a funnel to transfer to a different container. Maybe not everyone feel this way, though. "
Maik,4 years ago,4,"There are olive oils I rate a 5 but this is not one of them.  I bought it because it is available online during the shelter-in-place period. I usually don't use oils in plastic bottles.  It is adequate, though, and the quality is okay. "
Boone,4 years ago,5,It's Organic there is a lot and it's a good price. I use it in many recipes and on my 2nd one now. Only issue I have is the top You cant put a small pour spout in because of the tops size. Perhaps you can get a different size spout. 
klixtokw,3 years ago,4,Its OK for cooking & other uses but does not seem to be high quality and may be mixed with other oils or lower quality olive oil. This can be appreciated from the taste compared to a GUARANTEED high quality oil. The price is right. 
Kimberly,2 years ago,5,"I use Kirkland Signature Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil with all of the meats that I cook - chicken, turkey, pork and beef. Along with spices and vegetables, it adds a wonderful smooth taste to the meats and helps in tenderizing. "
Disgusted1,4 years ago,5,HOW ABOUT YOU SEND ME THE BRITA PITCHER THAT WAS BACK-ORDERED FOR MARCH 30TH AND WHICH YOU NEVER SENT.  YOU ALSO NEVER SENT A NOTICE.   I'VE BEEN A MEMBER SINCE 1994 AND YOUR A GREAT BOX STORE BUT YOU ARE AWFUL ONLINE WEBSITE. 
LarryVA,4 years ago,5,We've used them for years and always excellent; consistently excellent. Reviewed by consumer magazines and excellent results. The price is excellent. No negatives come to mind. We decant into an olive oil dispenser for easy use. 
3Mountains,2 years ago,5,"Good taste, recommended by someone I trust as being actual 100% extra virgin olive oil. Apparently there are a lot of ""fake"" extra virgin olive oils that are corrupted with other oils. Nice to know Costco sells good stuff. "
Allison Gilmor,3 years ago,5,Such a great olive oil. It’s a quality made oil with that distinct extra virgin olive oil smell. It not only cooks well but also adds great flavor to breads and salads. Half the price of most stores but better quality. 
Cindy,5 years ago,5,This is the only olive oil we have bought for several years.  We are confident that it is from California and is not the adulterated oil from Europe.   We are very pleased with this oil and recommend it to everyone. 
LMMX,2 years ago,5,This oil is so good.  It has that peppery bite that I love from a good olive oil. The price is remarkable and I just decanted it into another dispenser and put this away out of the light. I will not buy another oil. 
eric,3 years ago,5,Our favorite olive oil on the market.  When we buy this product it is with the confidence that we are getting organic olive oil (there are many fake olive oils being sold).  We love the taste and it is a good value. 
CedarTree,3 years ago,5,"This olive oil works equally well for sautéing or dressings & marinades. Light, mildly fruity taste, clear & unclouded color, light aroma. An excellent price per ounce compared to smaller bottles in grocery stores. "
Mel B,4 years ago,4,"Reliable quality at an affordable price.Of course single origin olive oil with date of pressing is an entirely different product.  But for your general needs (sautéing, dressings, etc) this is really very good. "
Judith,4 years ago,5,"This is a great olive oil. Fresh, spicy, and a lovely taste. However, unless you use a lot of it, best to decant half into a dark glass jar, since plastic jars do allow a small amount of air to enter over time. "
Lily,4 years ago,5,"I bake a lot and use olive for baking quick breads, cakes and muffins.  This oil is a wonderful substitute for other oils and butter.  Many times I use this oil and applesauce to replace the fat in the recipe. "
Doggy lover,3 years ago,5,Used for cooking and for salads with balsamic vinegar. Excellent in both uses. Is better than many olive oils including pricier one.  A good price point. Use it exclusively if it is available for purchase. 
LM16,4 years ago,5,I purchased this olive oil because I did research online and found that it is one of the few olive oils sold in the U.S. that actually meets the standard for extra-virgin olive oil. It is also affordable. 
HiPinkie,3 years ago,5,"I was raised in the Mediterranean and use a lot of olive oil for both salads and cooking. This is a great olive oil, balanced, slightly peppery and simply great for salads, pasta, and cooking veggies. "
Olivine,5 years ago,5,Organic superior quality and not too strong flavor. Good for health option for oil. No thanks to the GMO conventional oils with neurotoxin and carcinogen residues. Go organic for healthier lifestyle. 
Paula,3 years ago,5,"Best ""GO TO"" olive oil out there other than California Kitchen. I keep two 16 oz squeeze bottles filled; one with the EVOO and one with veggie oil; next to the stove, ready for whatever I'm cooking. "
Coffee lover,3 years ago,5,"Kirkland olive oil is better than any brand (even organic) I've purchased at any grocery store, and I use it so often I like the the large bottle. The price is extremely reasonable for such quality. "
Mlee,4 years ago,3,This olive oil is great but Costco shipping procedures are not. This was shipped to me and received with the spout/neck crushed in and various other damaged products in the box due to poor packing. 
YookHa,4 years ago,3,This EVOO has been highly rated and verified to be REAL (not fake).  I gave it three stars because it doesn't seem to have the various stamps of being authentic yet it has been judged as authentic. 
Mimi,2 years ago,5,"We use lots of olive oil for cooking, salads, skin and hair care. I switched from expensive brand name olive oils to Costco Kirkland Olive Oil years ago. It’s one of my favorite Kirkland products. "
luvdvm,4 years ago,5,We use a lot of extra virgin olive oil in our cooking so buying this large container is just right for our family.  It compares to other more expensive olive oils we've used so it's a great value. 
VegMom,3 years ago,5,We have used this for years for everything from salads to roasting/sautéing vegetables to frying eggs and every basic food prep in between. Cannot beat the price and value for this quality item. 
Mary,3 years ago,5,"We don't even think about trying any other olive oil. It's been years; my husband is an EVOO addict (just pour it on, don't bother to drizzle), and this satisfies both the mouth and the wallet. "
miracle,3 years ago,5,"I've used this for at least 5 years, and it's a great olive oil.  Very clean and good quality, not to mention a great price.  It's neutral enough to use for cooking as well as salad dressing. "
Steven,2 years ago,5,I brought these Kirkland olive oil due to tests done and for health reasons.  These are the kind of oils that you want to put into your body: oil that is natural and not chemically expelled. 
RobF,6 years ago,5,The Kirkland EVOO is a great buy. Not only does it taste great but when it’s used for cooking it performs like a very expensive Olive Oil.  I will continue to buy and use the Kirkland brand. 
mkchampe,6 years ago,5,I use olive oil everyday and am so thrilled to have found this by Kirkland Signature.  I know I can depend on it’s quality.  It has a great taste!  And I truly appreciate its affordability. 
ByteMee,2 years ago,5,"Way healthier than butter.  Way cheaper than any snack.  Our house pops 50 pounds a year.  Yes, a year.   We spend $125 annually or 25 bags of chips that are gonna kill you much faster. "
IT Guy,2 years ago,5,"Apparently a lot of oil labeled olive oil has other lesser oils mixed in and that isn't on the label, but this one was tested and found to be 100% olive oil.  And it tastes good as well. "
danthefrozenroseman,3 years ago,5,"A versatile EVO at a price point that allows a wide range of uses...great taste, balanced acidity, nice but not overpowering floral notes- it's my go-to oil for cooking and general use! "
The Spare Bear,6 years ago,5,"This typically has a pronounced flavor.  For those individuals who do not care for a stronger flavored olive oil, this might not be the best for you.  We love the rich buttery flavor. "
D Spencer,4 years ago,5,"We go through quite a bit of olive oil - we keep a beautiful glass bottle with an easy-pour top near the stove. This size gives us several refills, it's delicious and a great value! "
MNGritter,3 years ago,5,"Consistently, cheaper than other EVOO offerings, this olive oil is my go to for our family of 8.  I also like the subtle flavor difference compared to the EVOO's sourced from Italy. "
VashonV,3 years ago,5,"I trust the Kirkland Signature, and it is always my first choice in shopping. I know that this organic extra virgin olive oil is indeed ORGANIC EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL at its finest. "
California Chris,5 years ago,5,"We use it on everything we cook in place of butter, lard, or cooking oil.  Organic  EVOO provides an enhanced flavor in every meal  and is a burst of flavor that I crave and savor. "
Anonymous,4 years ago,5,"the very best Virgin Olive Oil. I had hoped to receive the lighter oil in the basic 2gal. for  $ 20 something. This is not the virgin olive oil, but its good on salads and cooking. "
Linda,4 years ago,5,I was hesitant about trying this since I'm very particular when it comes to Olive Oil. Well...I was amazed on how delicious this olive oil is! and it's organic! Highly recommend! 
Jeff N,4 years ago,4,"You can buy better olive oil, but you can't touch this price. Good option for everyday cooking. Save your high-priced stuff for dipping bread and drizzling on specialty dishes. "
lunamama,3 years ago,5,"Excellent quality. Excellent value. This is real olive oil, which can be difficult to find in stores. A lot of olive oil is diluted with other, less quality oils. Not this one! "
William,4 years ago,3,Having bought this product many times in the past did not realize that  in this occasion it is not of Italian provenance but of a variety of countries.Hope it tastes the same. 
Steve,3 years ago,5,"Good quality, good price! Manageable sized container. We regularly get this Costco product (we find most Costco products are excellent - which is why we keep shopping there). "
Duane,4 years ago,5,There are a lot of fake olive oils on the market.  This one solidifies when it is in the refrigerator which is one of the signs of olive oil.  Taste is good for all purpose. 
Shopper,2 years ago,5,The oil is good but I’ve not had a  good experience with Costco.com and their shipping. Twice the box was opened or torn apart when it arrived or I didn’t get all my items. 
Dave,3 years ago,5,"Superb quality, taste and price. The only cooking oil in the house, from roasting vegetables, cooking fish and chicken to baking (e.g., bread, zucchini bread, carrot cake). "
Kaye,4 years ago,5,Good flavor that holds up to dipping a good focaccia in it ... the flavor is a great compliment to all uses ... my favorite EVOO - worth their pric  Ed of membership alone 
Ajantala,4 years ago,5,"I have used Kirkland Organic  Extra Virgin Olive Oil for years, in salad and main dishes and to add to some relishes.    It has a good taste and texture in your mouth. "
Biggs,3 years ago,4,"Quality at a value.  This OEVOO is good for cooking and seasoning, perfectly serviceable for most applications.  I don't consider this a gourmet item but everyday use. "
marybajcz,3 years ago,5,We use this as our all purpose oil.   It has a very light olive scent; you might like a more flavorful oil for certain applications where a distinct flavor is desired. 
design goddess,3 years ago,5,This olive oil is consistently fresh tasting  with a delicious  mild olive scent.. Have been using it for years.  Please keep carrying it !!! Also a very good bargain 
ProfessorPJ,4 years ago,5,The smell of this olive oil is like it was freshly pressed!  The taste is like fresh olives which enhances the meat or vegetables cooked in it.  Absolutely wonderful! 
Rob B,4 years ago,5,"This is good stuff and it comes in a size that supports my copious consumption. I have found no alternatives, for no lack of trying. The quality and price are right! "

Aggi,2 years ago,5,"I purchase 'specialty' olive oils to have for certain recipes/food preparation, but I always keep a bottle of the Kirkland Organic EVOO in my pantry for general use. "
Masooma,3 years ago,4,The top should be made more reliable as you the cannot secure it completely and the oil spilled as it fell straight for a second .other wise  the product is fine. 
PeterGS,4 years ago,5,"Excellent product ... it’s a blend of the best Mediterranean olives, fruity and deep dark color. I will only buy this or pure Kalamata first cold press olive oil. "

SDKM,3 years ago,3,"These gloves are thinner and smaller than other brands our family has used. They work fine for me and our older kids, but not for the hubby. His hands busted clean through in just trying to put them on. We use these gloves for food prep, while shopping (to try and keep our hands clean when using a grocery cart) and for those messy jobs like cleaning up after the dog. If you’re looking for a size comparison, I typically wear a size medium in nitrile gloves and these gloves are just slightly big on me. To be honest, I expected a slightly higher quality glove given that Costco sells these. "
Achie,a month ago,3,Guidelines says avoid mentioning competitors - but comparison is one of the best way to share my thoughts.  Costco used to carry that brand ( it has the word Clean . . . ) - it's thicker and stronger than this.  Good enough vs better or best.  Settling for what's available and good enough.  Please bring back the better . . . One ;) 
FayeAway,3 years ago,5,"Great price and acceptable quality.  However, they are very thin and the size seems to be more suited for someone with large hands and unrealistically long fingers.  I usually wear two in each hand when handling raw chicken and ground beef to avoid liquid soaking through onto my skin.  Still a good value for the money even though I almost always have two gloves in each hand. They are food-handlers glove, therefore they are not suited for cleaning as they will soak through even when doubled. "
Love my gloves,5 years ago,3,The inside cuff seems a bit too short based on other gloves I've tried that are similar also once in a while when putting them on or taking them off the seam closest to the thumb rips open also I had a box where some of them had the three middle fingers  sliced open at the base so when you put your fingers in they came right out of the glove and I didn't notice them until after I had picked up some nasty things so not happy about that 
Green Eyed Monster,5 days ago,5,These are really good gloves. They don’t tear and they open easy to put on. They fit both my husband and me well and despite the different size of our hands. We use them around the house for quick wipe ups and food prep for messy foods or raw meat. I have even used them when adding soil to little pots for seed starting. Would definitely order again if I ever use all of them! 
John,3 years ago,1,I Like these gloves they go apply a little which are nice and they’re easy to put on because one side of the glove is a little bit lower than the other so you can open it easy and to put on And the price was good I was unable to find them in the store I got them online they seem to run out pretty quick I wish they would keep them in stock but I like them very much and they work very well well 
Beej,3 years ago,1,"Unfortunately what you see in the pictures (on the box) is not what you get. The deceptively nicely fitting vinyl looking gloves on the box picture is nothing like the loosely fit, low quality plasticky gloves you'll get 2000 of. Quite surprised by the quality of these gloves. I would not recommend them nor buy them again. "
picky purchaser,4 years ago,1,"Pitiful.  So thin, tore for any reason.  Also, One-Size is ridiculous, unless you have huge hands.  Did not return only because I didn't pay enough to fight the crowds for this amount. I only ordered as I can't get the nitrile gloves I have bought for years for food prep.  These shortages are disgusting. "
costarica2016,4 years ago,5,"The shortage of disposable gloves during the pandemic has been rough on all the food industry. But we are thankful for Costco and the prompt delivery of these fantastic gloves. They ave very durable, compared to other brands we had used in the past. Highly recommended. "
Byanyothername,4 years ago,1,"Awful. Awkward shape and fit, slippery and fragile; so lightweight they're like flyaway hairs. More often than not the first one breaks through the fingertips so I always have to double layer them. Will be very glad when they're finally used up. "
Librarian,4 years ago,4,These gloves are very large and thin. They’re good for quick cooking tasks that do not require fingertip agility. I also wear them for light household tasks like polishing furniture. The price is great for the large number of gloves. 
NikonUser99,18 days ago,5,"Does the job for a good price. Thin but nice, all for a Costco price. Will keep your hands clean when handling food preparation, or when serving guests/family members.  Also useful to keep hands clean when picking up after your pet, "
eve422,4 years ago,3,I use them for this challenging covid-19 times to go shopping. They are loose (one size fits most) and they get off easily. Can't use them in the kitchen for the same reason...try to cut onion when you don't have a real grip. 
Happy buyer,3 years ago,1,"I don’t like because I’m petite also got small Hands that slippery out on me constantly just absolutely no good! No, not. Working for planty of people complaining the same just not because of the sizes! Must return so I did! "
Golfer,3 years ago,5,Perfect for preparing food.  I can use multiple pairs in the preparation of one chicken dish.  They protect my hands so I don't have to wash them 10 times in the course of preparation and they are very inexpensive to use. 
Wes T,4 years ago,3,"They look much more fitting than they are. These are very thin and very big. Like they were made out of very cheap plastic baggies, pressed into hand shape. They work, but they aren't the level of quality I expected. "
shopper,4 years ago,4,"These are good for one time use for collecting the mail, taking out garbage, opening doors, cleaning toilets.  They are flimsy, and tear if you put to much stress on them, but they only cost 1/2 cent a piece. "
WcoastGrl,4 years ago,5,"These are not closely fitting gloves but we love these for tasks that don't require closely fitting ones.  Use for all sorts of things - getting gas, opening public doors, etc.  Lightweight but do the job! "
iduj,4 years ago,2,gloves are too bulky for my wife which makes it difficult to cut food without also cutting the gloves and thus introducing plastic into the food. Thus these gloves have limited usefulness to her. 
AVJMIL,2 years ago,1,I hate these gloves. They remind me of wearing a sandwich bag on each hand. They fall off and they have zero grip. I have no idea what I’m going to do with them. Pretty useless. 
Tina,3 years ago,2,"I know they’re one size fits all, but they were way too loose and were made for short fingers, which makes them feel like they’re not on all the way. Not very happy with these. "
Meticulous,3 years ago,2,It is on the larger side for plastic gloves which is good but the quality is terrible. They get torn easily while wearing because the plastic on the fingers don't open easily. 
You Asked,5 years ago,1,"I hate these gloves. They are flimsy and won't stay on your hands. Loved the ones they used to carry in the store, so I gave these a chance. Huge mistake. "
Mike,4 years ago,5,"Great product for one time use in any situation, such as handling hazardous Materials, messy food or cleaning chores. Moderate pricing is an added bonus. "
Victoria,5 years ago,1,"The picture is very missleading, I thought I was ordering fitted gloves. The latex feeling gloves, but these are plastic and very loose fitting. "
Steve Burger Fest Seymour,3 years ago,4,Why the limit on quantity of 1 pack had to order two times on separate orders and pay shipping twice for the quantity I needed for my event. 
Ray Jay,3 years ago,4,These are priced right but are pretty thin. Be prepared to Rip one occasionally when attempting to put on. Still a good value for light use.

jstateson,2 years ago,1,"Followed instructions when first turned on:  Drained 4 full cups (quart) of water immediately.  System blink and beeped indicating out of water.  I drained 2-4 more cups and it seemed to start working here is the problem:  If you drain a tea cup or coffee cup of water then it thinks it is out of water and beeps a warning for 30 second and then blinks the red warning light constantly, It will no longer cool or heat until an addition 4-6 cups (1.5 quarts) are drained.  It is not possible to get a single tea cup or coffee cup of water and have the machine continue to cool or heat.  It immediately shuts down thinking it is out of water. "
AKcustomer,3 years ago,1,"Product does not work. Instructions have been written by someone who doesn't know English. No matter how long you keep pressing the hot water button, no water comes out. For those who say it works, it should just be a matter of time before something breaks. The build quality is extremely cheap. Costco, please stop carrying this item as it causes inconvenience to your customers, many of whom are senior citizens and it's a lot of work for them to bring it back to the store for returns. "
chefGB1,4 years ago,1,The instructions seem to be written by a 5 year old. Attempted to set it up but the system would not create a vacuum so that water would draw from the bottle and fill the reservoir. Was unable to get it operational. Contacted customer service for the distributor. Absolutely worthless. Basically wanted me to fill out forms and go back and forth with email. This is not customer service. Thanks to Costco's return policy I was able to return for a full refund. 
PES97,3 years ago,1,I BOUGHT THIS TO REPLACE THE PREVIOUS WATERCOOLER AS ITS MOTOR QUIT WORKING.  I TRIED IT AFTER RUNNING THE “FLUSH” AND THE WATER TASTED OF “PLASTIC” THEN IMPROVED A LITTLE BUT AS THE BOTTLE WAS EMPTYING IT TASTED WORSE AND WORSE.  THE CUP AREA IS TOO SMALL AND IS HALF MOON SO UNDER THE COLD OR HOT IT IS TOO SMALL AN AREA TO SET YOUR CUP.  IT RUNS A LOT AND IS LOUD AS WELL AS HAVING AN UNPLEASANT MOTOR SOUND TOO HIGH PITCHED AND ANNOYING.  IT DOES NOT HAVE A SELF CLEANING FEATURE - PROBABLY MY BAD AS I THOUGHT I READ THAT IT DID. 
Mburke,5 years ago,1,"I am very disappointed in the quality of the item. I will be waiting for the store to stock the Culligan dispenser and will be returning this one. It looks and feels cheaply made. The bottle connection pops off the tops of the plastic water containers all the time, it leaves a good 3 inches of water when the water has to be changed, it's not very cold and the water comes out very slow. "
M Rennie,4 years ago,3,"We had bought one previously from Costco and loved it but gave it to our daughter when she moved out.  Bought this one thinking it was the same one and this one does not have the night light that shines down where you fill up the water.  This one also has 3 different spickets for the various temperatures so it's easy to miss and get water all over. Also the top tube that goes onto the bottle is extremely tight and it is a battle to get the filler tube onto the water bottle.  Definately disappointed, not the same... "
MoeMoe,4 years ago,1,Gave this item a chance after reading all the negative reviews. Was delivered broken and not worth what we paid for it. Do not waste your time or money. Taking this item back tomorrow. 
Rosa E,4 years ago,1,"Had this for 3 weeks, it worked great for that time. Then I noticed that there was a huge puddle of water at the base, and on the side vent. Apparently this is not fixable so I will be returning it for a refund. For reference I had Primo brand before and worked great. Decided to try this one but was a total fail and waste of money! "
BJUE,5 years ago,3,"you need to improve on certain items, such as when you put the 5 gallon water into the cooler, it was very hard to push down the cap onto to the 5 gallon top of the water bottom and just as hard to pull the cap off the water bottles.  also to squeeze the tab on the cap is very hard for  senior citizen to squeeze to make it easy to put cap on the bottle. "
Anonymous,4 years ago,1,"Looked great when it arrived, but the cold water never actually worked.  The hot did as did the ambient temp, but there was never cold water.  I will be returning this to the store today and not buying another.  Also, this one was a replacement of a previous Frigidaire water cooler that only lasted about 18 months. "
NATZ,4 years ago,4,"THE OPERATING MANUAL DOESN'T CLEARLY SPECIFY FOR ANY OPTION LIKE: KEEP PRESSING HOT TAB FOR WATER TO FLOW OUT BEFORE PLUGGING-IN THE POWER CORD. TRIED SEVERAL TIMES IT DID NOT PUMP WATER AT ALL, UNTIL I DID OTHERWISE AND SO FAR IT WENT WELL. "
Not satisfies,2 years ago,1,I bought this item 2 months ago and was working perfectly fine until last week it started giving me problems. The water is not very cold and the light flashes to replace the gallon when it is still half way! I had a previous model purchased from Costco 6 years ago that worked perfect that entire time. Things aren’t made the same anymore. This item is very cheap and will stop working in about 2 months. I will be returning and purchase a different one. Save yourself the hassle and don’t purchase! 
Christopher,4 years ago,2,"It is honestly not very durable, the water seizes sometimes and the pressure won't make any flow of water...so, you will think ur water is finished "
Matt,3 months ago,4,"This is the second one I've gotten. The first one had issues with the pump just under the warranty time period. It is simply branded ""frigidaire"", but it made by a contractor. The fittings are nice and pex pressure fittings. When it is working it works well. No temperature adjustments but you have power switches for hot or cold water. I dont use the hot water feature, so I enjoy that I can shut it off. It is a little noisy, but no more than others I've owned. I keep it in the dining room so no big deal. Overall, I think it is a win. I am grateful for the Costco service. Because it may not last more than one year. "
Jess,4 years ago,1,Received broken. Plastic hinge on the door was broken off. Had to return to the store and never had a chance to use it. 
JieQ,4 years ago,1,"I just receive this machine,top botton had a lot scratch,and box is repacked,i don't want speak too much,return it. "
Tony,4 years ago,1,"Low pressure water flow, especially hot water. I had to return item. "
Will,3 years ago,1,"Really bad water cooler. Makes a loud noise during its refrigeration processes, along with not being able to store sufficient water at a cool temperature. No light or guide for water spouts. Does not warn you until the water is completely empty and will make a beeping noise until you replace the water or simply shut it off. Other than a clean looking design, it’s not worth the price. Considering returning this product. "
Vivi,4 years ago,5,So far so good. I like that it has 3 different dispensers and cleans easily. Makes a bit of noise when refilling but its only noticeable when the house is quiet. 
Anonymous,4 years ago,5,"It's easy to load/unload, and the water comes out steaming hot or ice cold! Really happy with the jug being hidden, looks nice in my kitchen. "
Pablo T,4 years ago,1,"What a complete piece of garbage. Recieved this on Tuesdays, noticed it was leaking on Wednesday. The entire thing is cheaply made. "
Amgad,4 years ago,5,"The least expensive in the market and backed up by Costco. One of the things about that some people may like or not that it has 3 water outlets, one for the hot water one for the cold and one for the room temperature. I personally wish they were all combined in one outlet "
Ger Lins,2 years ago,4,"I LOVE having the convenience of hot water on tap. I can do my coffee in the morning instantly (so to speak)... One thing that removed the 5th star is that you have to ""break it in"" - the first few gallons have this unpleasant rubbery-taste, it goes away and you can do the whole cleaning thing with vinegar and etc. But, it would've been nice to just plug it in and go without the trouble. "
Jaytee,a year ago,4,"My wife and I ordered this hot/cold water dispenser after seeing the one my brother had and how easy and convenient it was to use. Since we live out in the country and are on a well, we have been filling 1 gallon bottles at a water dispensing station in downtown Paso Robles for our drinking purposes which proved to be a hassle and took up too much storage space in our garage. Now, we have the 5 gallon water bottles delivered and we don’t have to lift them up to fill the tank since the water storage is at the bottom of the unit.  We didn’t want to rent the unit so we bought it through Costco and it was delivered promptly.  So far, the unit has worked great for hot/cold and room temp water. "
AP1234,4 years ago,1,"I have owned this for maybe 3 months and it has started leaking , the water does Not come out very cold. I am very disappointed and will be returning it "
Mike,3 years ago,1,Instructions are completely useless.  We followed the instructions (if you want to call it that) for the better part of an hour trying to get this thing to work then decided to discard the instructions and just figure it out intuitively - which is what we should have done in the first place.  Do yourself a favor and throw away the tiny instruction paper that is sent along with this product and just figure it out yourself.  You'll save yourself a lot of time and headache. 
Greg D,3 years ago,3,"It started off as a 5 star product. That being said, the unit is slowly getting louder and louder when pumping water from the bottle. Considering a return due to increasing noise. It looks great and sleek but i get the feeling that the internal design is cheap and wont hold up to my household use. We are only three people and it seems to not be able to handle this low  load. Kinda disappointing considering the PREMIUM price. "
Amarrero,3 months ago,3,"We will be returning this to the warehouse and picking up the Primo that is currently in warehouse. Using my thermometer, I measured Room temp water is 69* and the cold water is 63*. Product description claims cold water should be 41*. Door is hard to open to change out bottles. "
Costco Shopper,5 years ago,5,"It works great, the hot water is hot, the cold water is cold, and the cool water is a bit colder than I would personally prefer.  But it was a great purchase.  I only wish it came in white. "
Mary,5 years ago,5,"Lovely water cooler.  Mine is in my middle school classroom for students' use.  It gets some heavy use every day all day. Easy to clean, easy to change the water jugs.  Water is always cold and ready.  I turned off the hot water to prevent accidental use by monkeys. "
Rachel Swing,3 years ago,1,"Bought for a Christmas present for the family.  Box arrived in decent condition.   Opened it up, made sure heating and cooling switches were off, and plugged it in.  Pushed the hot dispensing button until water came out (which means the tank is full).  I left it sit for 24 hours and then turned on the cold switch.   Cooling doesn't work.   Turned the switch on and off again and waited and still no cooling. "
Eve C,2 years ago,3,Definitely not as good as the 1st one I bought from Costco. This one does not have a light. And the tray is smaller so cups fall off. Door is plastic and not sturdy. And I paid double for this one. 
Nothappy,3 years ago,1,I received this as a gift was so excited to use it and then got really disappointed. The door hinge was broken and the side was dented. I haven’t used the product and still waiting for UPS to pick up the broken water cooler and drop off a new one. After reading all the reviews I’m not sure if I want one. Why is the company sending broken products it’s a waste of time and money. 
David,7 months ago,2,"Seems like a vert very basic model.  No light where water dispenses.  Cheaper fill system, more flimsy.  Rattles when the fan shuts off.  Nothing like the other Frigidaire model I replaced with this one.  Last one lasted 5-6 years.  But I figured it is a Frigidaire and it should last and be built well.     Not pleased.  Wish I would have gone with the Primo brand this time. "
BBBB,2 years ago,1,". We previously had a Culligan water cooler that stopped working and we had returned, only they didnt have a replacement so I gave this brand a shot. We had the water cooler for a few days. There were no instructions included, only warranty info. I remembered the first time use instructions from the Culligan cooler, and applied it to this dispenser. For several day we were getting an awful metallic taste in our water, we wasted a whole 5 gal bottle trying to get rid of the taste. Returned ASAP. "
Anonymous,4 years ago,1,"Unit replaced failed unit with leak. Unit of poorer quality. Slow water delivery, no light, small cup tray, less substantial. "
Amruta,10 months ago,1,The hot water wasn’t working properly. When I got a replacement it had drain leak issue. Ended up returning both. 
Penny M,3 years ago,1,Just started using it 2 days ago after we moved into our new place. The cold water is NOT cold at all! The hot water and room temp water works just fine. I saw the negative reviews about the cold water after we bought it. Wish we would have bought a different brand. Now we’re stuck with it or we would have to drag it to a warehouse to return it. 
Thaer,4 years ago,3,Price wise it is OK but since I read the people reviews and many said there is leaks I thought I would be lucky and get one with no leak But But But  I am NOT purchased one and set it next to the kitchen cabinet worked well came back from work and found the flood the cold water valve was leaking and water on the floor every where. 
Jami L,2 years ago,1,Would prefer no stars.  I returned it.  It would not prime.  As I was in line to return a gentleman came up behind me with 2 in his cart that he was returning for the same reason.  I will wait for Costco to carry another brand before I order again.  If they don't I'll have to go elsewhere. 
The Bear,3 years ago,1,"This unit arrived and was clearly refurbished.  What taking out of the box, water was coming out of the unit. Thought I would set it up and it wouldn't work. I don't expect to pay full price for refurbished products and I guess I expected more from Costco. Returning to Costco tomorrow. "
Cjspeciale,4 years ago,1,I bought this less than one year ago and have already replaced it. It is noisy and the water is not very hot or cold. It finally gave out around under a year of use. Bottom loaders May look nicer but are not efficient and of quality. Thankful that Costco has satisfaction guarantee! 
Sluc,2 years ago,1,We had to order thus product 2 times due to it being delivered broken and after the second attempted we gave up on order any item to be delivered due to receiving a broke twice. We returned both water dispensers each time shortly right after delivery which was an inconvenience. 
Jean M,a year ago,2,"Not as good as the Hamilton Beach bottle setup, unit broke with barely moving it. Although the Hamilton Beach did not last over 2 years (2 years to the day, really). Had to return this Frigidaire and buy a different brand elsewhere. "
MamaBear,a year ago,1,This cooler makes your water taste plastic/chemical like! I gave it time to go away and it never did. Do not waste your time or energy on this. I replaced with primo bottom loader and it is so worth spending the few extra dollars. 
Costco member,a year ago,1,"I received this dispenser broken on the side. Made of plastic, my old unit was steel on the sides. I did not reorder although Costco was very good about giving me a refund. I do not recommend this product though. "
LBLb,4 years ago,1,"Took out of box and did not work. Followed instructions, and called customer service, they needed photos and serial number sent to them. Response back was to return to store. We returned the water cooler. "
Marilee,2 years ago,1,We will be returning this product.  We went through an entire bottle of water and still could not get rid of the nasty taste or smell.  It did not work properly with the 3 gallon bottle of water.  We tried getting help and could not access the website.  We finally contacted customer service and he was located in the Philippines and said it was probably best to return it.  Certainly not what we expected from a Technical Support Rep. 
MesaFamily,4 years ago,1,"COSTCO ad says this fits thee and five gallon bottles, but beware - the shaft is too long for 3 gallons. No conversion kit or shorter shaft is available from the manufacturer. Very disappointing! "
Did not heat or cool,7 months ago,1,Did not heat or cool water. We tried trying the switch off and on and tried to reset it but still did not work. I’ve heard of issues with bottom loaders before but thought I would give it a try. 
SAL ISIAS,2 years ago,1,the unit came in a box and after I opened the box it appeared the the unit has been used or returned .... because it was broken parts and scratches everywhere ...  and I had to return it

Miami,2 years ago,1,Unfortunately the water dispenser was delivered in poor condition and was cracked on the top.  Item was returned to a Costco nearby for full refund.  We never got to use it. 
Patrice,2 years ago,1,It broke within days of receiving it. We actually haven't even returned it yet. A piece of the straw like part that goes directly into the water jug snapped as we were snapping everything back together while putting a fresh jug of water in. We've used the crystal springs delivery service through Costco for years and rented their water coolers. Those coolers have a much more flexible straw like part so this never happened.

He was truly the saving grace on this debacle of a delivery!!! My Service Request # is 220601-031074 and the resolution team is saposto reach out to me. I had to pay to have someone come out and remove the old frig & put in the new one in its place.  The delivery persons contracted were horrible, they left the new frig in the entry way of our lobby. They never even had us sign anything saying they left it and they were rude and totally unprofessional. Please see the detail notes left by costco customer service that was helping us through the whole ordeal. The service people even hung up on him. "

Anonymous,4 years ago,1,leaking unit - returned to store 
WillS,3 years ago,1,"It looks pretty, but the looks are deceiving. I bought this two weeks ago and need to return it already.  It leaks randomly from the cold side.  I either lose half the water or end up trying to catch all the water coming from the unit into multiple cups.  The unit is also extremely noisy.  If you are a light sleeper, don't expect to get a lot of sleep when the compressor kicks on. "
Alen,2 years ago,3,"It took about 3 weeks for the taste of metal to almost go away. Its still there though. Not sure why. Tried to find out from a sales person, but he said just exchange it. I am keeping it since the metal taste is going away, and it was there because the unit was new. Just didn't want to go through the same experience to exchange it. "
Nancy,5 years ago,1,Didn’t work from the start 
Mark,2 years ago,3,"The cold water never reached anything lower than 48 degrees and most of the time was near room temperature. I believe it was a defect, but can’t say for sure since I didn’t get a replacement.  Although it was a pain in the butt to lug it back to Costco, I was able to return it with the greatest of ease. "
Elizabeth A,2 years ago,1,The door came broken - I did not need to open the door when it arrived because the water from Refresh came days later on Friday.  When I took the tape off the door the door opened and then fell out - the bottom hinge was broken - It is now tapped closed so that the water can come out 
Trish,2 years ago,3,So far we've run 5 gallons for water through it and the water still tastes like plastic. Can't find the dispenser on the frigidaire website for ideas and teh instructions didn't mention flushing which is what we've been doing to try to clear it up. 
Mom02,4 years ago,1,This bottom loading water cooler is so easy to set up and use. The cooler chills the water rather quickly and the hot water function can easily be switched off when not in use. I would highly recommend this product.

Tim F,2 years ago,1,I heard a lot of good things about this.  The item really doesnt work.  the hot water and cold water dont get too hot and cold.  disappointed in a costco product. 
Emysdad,8 months ago,4,We bought this water cooler over 3 years ago and the pump finally died today.  We were so happy with the reliability and especially the durability of this unit. Our family of 4 consumes lots of water (we're apparently part camel) so this cooler was really put to the test and passed with flying colors. The only criticism I can give is the plastic it's made of seems a little thin but it never broke or gave us any trouble.  We will definitely purchase the same model to replace it. 
Rosie,3 months ago,1,It is only for 5 gallon water bottles. I use the 3 gallon ones. Nowhere on the description did it say you could not use it on a 3 gallon bottle.

Paul G,2 years ago,1,Poor quality. Very bad taste even after five gallons of water. And didn't get cold enough. And lastly it was very noisy.

David M,3 years ago,4,This is not a bad water dispenser for the money. It looks good. It’s a bottom load so you don’t have that ugly bottle sitting on top. And it has a room temperature water option. My only complaint is that the hot water is not very hot and it doesn’t even come out the same temperature every time. The dispenser I had before was extremely consistent and reliable when it came to water temp so that’s the reason for my disappointment with this one. I’ll still give it 4/5 start. 
RGN two,3 years ago,5,Everything is working beautifully! Small hiccup with the instructions! But the company explain there was a typo. 
1Picky,2 years ago,4,It’s loud when it refills. When changing the water bottle the hose leaks water all over that is in the hose. 
Disappointed,3 years ago,3,The space where you put your glass to get water is not tall enough to use a tall glass or a hydro flask.

Terry,2 years ago,4,"I like this better than the Lumina dispenser, easier to change water bottles, not complicated. It had metallic taste for only couple of days. It’s a little noisy only after getting water, otherwise it is quiet. When it was delivered, the whole package was upside down and the top cover was removed. There’s no manual/ instructions anything about what all these green lights or why the red light turns on. I hope this water dispenser will last longer than 6 months. "

MG  Pa,2 years ago,1,"I purchased this unit in June of 2022 (this year). The unit worked until a part failed on the water line. The customer support is terrible. They have not supported the product. I complied with all of the information they required, but I called the Customer Support and only get people after a long delay who can only apologize for not being of any help. Understand that if you order this product you will have no support from Curtis or Costco! "
Doug,4 years ago,4,"The price was right for this one. There are three different water dispensers , cold, room and hot.. The hot is hotter than expected. Our previous water cooler was very loud , this one is not. It has rubber feet on that appears to dampen the sound. I wish it had an LED light to enable filling a glass in the dark. "
Chris,3 years ago,5,"I am very happy so far with this water dispenser. Cold is cold, hot is very hot. I like that it has a room temperature setting also. The dispenser works as advertised. I cancelled monthly delivery and opted to purchase my own dispenser, so far happy with the decision. My only criticism vs the rented cooler is the fact that this dispenser doesn’t have a light. The rental would light up while dispensing. "
Crap water cooler,6 months ago,1,"It did not cool the water as advertised. Heat yes, dispensing was good but the water did not cool and was served at room temp from the cooler button (not the room temp button). "
Linda,3 years ago,1,This unit never had a working hot water section.  We contacted Curtis international Limited and they gave us a case number with the idea they would send someone out to look at it.  Once we sent in the model and serial number to them they they determined they would not send one out to fix it they told us to take it back to the store for a refund.  This was a disappointing. 
Gary,8 months ago,1,Awful. Could never get it to take in water. AlsoCouldn’t get a return call from the manufacturer to problem solve. Returned it 
Anonymous,4 years ago,5,Great Size For A Small Space Not Bulky and Keeps the Water Very Cold 
Scooter Girl,10 months ago,5,So far it's working fine.  Looks very nice. Water is dispensed very easily.I followed the installation steps carefully before plugging in the cooler and turning on the hot and cold switches. Hot water didn't flow out of the tap as described. But the cold water flowed out of the tap. So I plugged in and flipped the switches. 
MomOku,3 years ago,4,Bought this one over the more expensive Culligan brand and now wonder if I made the right decision.  The Instructions are not really clear when setting up.  Hot water is really not very hot and chilled water not that chilled.  Other than that system is fine for our purposes to dispense bottled water. 
Anonymous,4 years ago,4,"I love the convenience of this dispenser and the fact that I'm no longer filling the environment with plastic water bottles.  My only complaint about it is that the water doesn't get as cold as I'd like it to.  However, it does chill it more than room temp.  All in all I'm happy with it. "
TG in SD,3 years ago,2,Ordered this item as a gift.  First shipment contained a damaged unit that was not operable.  Returned it to the store and reordered a second unit online.  Just found out from the person I gave it to a month ago that the unit does not produce cold water.  Very disappointed. 
Cleo,3 years ago,4,Very easy to set up. So easy to use that my kids can operate the cold waters by themselves and I love that the hot water is “locked” so that they cant hurt themselves although it’s easy to operate as well. It also looks very sleek and is not too bulky.. Highly recommend! 
no name,11 months ago,5,"I had a VIVA from Costco for 8 years, it died. I replaced with this unit. It is taller and makes more noise when filling and fills slower, but overall, no issue. Instructions are horrible. Doesn't tell you much, but I made my way through. Nice looking unit. "
Nbit,3 years ago,1,"Tried to follow the basic direction and prime the hot water before plugging in power and nothing happened, no bubbles and no water from the first two spouts. The cod spout worked but it dribbled out very slowly, even with power on... bad product overall "
Mary Jo,2 years ago,1,we opened the cooler new out of the box.  Despite many efforts we could never get it to work and have water flowing.  Returned it to Costco.  They made the return easy and painless unlike the mfg who kept promising to call and help us.  Never happened. 
Leeeeeee,3 years ago,4,"I really like this water cooler. But I only give it four stars because it only takes a 5 gallon bottle. With my bad back I have to fill 6 3 gallon bottles I have at the store, then pour the water into the 5 gallon bottle for the cooler. "
Anonymous,2 years ago,1,"I don't like leaving bad reviews, but the water pressure is so low on the machine that it takes forever to fill a water bottle or full glass. Cold water isn't always cold, either. Prefer the old school top loading tap from 20 years ago. "
Emilie,a year ago,4,Everything about it works great. It's nice to have three options for water temperature. The ONLY thing I would prefer is having one spout for the water rather than 3 individuals spouts for each temp. Other than that it's been good. 
Kevin,4 years ago,4,Unfortunately this product dose not made with good quality on the out side but its work fine and it can not pomp about half gallon water at the end you have to manually drain it but the price is good cold and hot water are good 
Tartare,3 years ago,5,"We love the new easy bottom loading water dispenser.  I just wish there were arrows aligned on the 3 spouts so we can tell exactly where and which (hot/cold or tap) water is coming out from. All in all, it's a great purchase! "

Mindful_Matters,2 years ago,3,"My husband REALLY loves this machine! It makes a perfect cup every time. And it really is a brain cup too. It doesn’t get 5 stars though because the company provides zero replacement parts for the machine. And the hard plastic reservoirs are prone to crack or break way before their time. The only way to get it fixed is to be able to return the entire machine and replace it. I think that is horrible. Makes it so the machine will only lay as long as its weakest part. That’s pretty much the worst product support, as well as horribly wasteful! I’ve since seen so many of these machines in discount stores without the plastic reservoirs. Shameful. "
23skidoo,2 years ago,1,"I am returning this ""one-touch"" espresso maker.  Very difficult to cram and turn the device holding the grounds in the machine.  Takes several tries and some muscle.  Maybe mine is defective?  The milk container is also a struggle to insert-not easy when it is full of liquid. Not easy to clean the frother either  Automatic cycle is okay, but then you must take everything apart-take the spouts off, and they are full of milk residue.  I tried keeping the milk container in the refrigerator between times of making coffee-didn't work- had sour tasting froth. I found that I wouldn't use the machine-just too much trouble.  The coffee was good, though. "
lynn,3 years ago,5,"Such an easy and affordable upgrade for my coffee routine! I can tweak the strength of coffee and among of foams, after many tries, I do a double shot cappuccino, once completed, I select single shot cappuccino, that makes about the whole mug and not too strong/weak. I hesitate purchasing espresso machine because the cleanup, but the clean button seems working fine, no complain thus far. Ps- this is a replacement machine, first one stopped working (no frothed milk) on the 2nd day, I called Mr. Coffee customer service for trouble shoot, they are no help, all they told me was I am under warranty. Glad I purchased from Costco, easy replacement and return. "
dphpdx,3 years ago,5,I LOVE my CoffeeHouse - Worth Every Penny  and I mean it!  I had a DeLonghi simple espresso machine and enjoyed the cappuccinos I made.  I saw this on coupon and immediately ordered it. It really simplifies the process.  The maker is very easy to clean.  I store the milk compartment in my frig and it is ready to use the next morning.  The results are almost as good as ordering from Starbucks.  I now have Cappuccinos in the morning with skim milk and I can ditch my sweetened coffee creamer saving lots of calories.  Just follow the quick-start guide and you'll be on the road to really great lattes and cappuccinos in the morning.  COSTCO should sell this item in their stores - you'd sell a gazillion of them! 
BobInMich,3 years ago,5,"Quality latte' done very easily.  No skill required.  I make double shot latte's at the light foam setting.  The flavor with Starbucks Veranda Blond, self-grind, is excellent.  Coffee comes out very hot, and the steamed milk is 148 degrees:  perfect.  Follow the instructions!  Grounds should be like fine beach sand, not flour.  This is really a simple push-button espresso maker.  I love having this available every day, and I've used it every day but 4 in the 7 weeks since I've purchased it.  It's already paid for itself.  I use an AeroPress round paper filter, but it isn't necessary.  The self-cleaning function for the milk steamer is convenient.  Yes, the latte' is just as good as from the coffee shop. "
IslayMile,3 years ago,1,"Please don’t order this. You have to push the buttons dozens of times to work, and Mr. Coffee refused to honor the warranty (I’m still within the warranty period!) and just told me to take it to Costco. Shame on Sunbeam for selling such a defective product, look at the other reviews to see how many people have had this problem with defective buttons. Also, the milk frothier is designed terribly, and clogs up when it does work, and attaching and detaching it is a pain. Just poorly engineered from start to finish, and now I have to return it. Bummer. "
Tony,3 years ago,5,"Bought this when on sale for $129, wanted cap / latte machine but not ready to spend 600-5000 dollars, have been using every day for 3 weeks, it makes a cap as good as my friends brev.... $700 machine.  Would recommend. Separate milk container kept in fridge is awesome, although CAUTION: be careful not to grab milk container by the top (black part) the bottom will slip right off. It makes an automatic cap or latte and clean up is just remove grind holder, bang in garbage pale separate inner sizing cup and rinse,  then wipe underside of water outlet and drip tray, and nozzle for frothed milk , and put milk container in fridge. Simple, even for a man...   Clean the milk container once a week, it comes apart.  Love the simplicity. "
John W,3 years ago,1,"I bought this in January 2021 and have not been able to get the expected results. When the milk frother does its thing, it rolls out steam like a house on fire, but puts out milk at a slow drip. When asking for a large latte, the preset process finishes with about 4 oz. in the cup, instead of the 18 oz. that the instructions say a large produces. You can get it done with the manual operation, but I don't have the desire to spend that much time on it. I'm not a espresso crema foamer, so the manual espresso function was adequate, usually. I am returning this Mr. Coffee One-Touch machine and going with a manual steamer wand for more control and flexibility to steam my lattes, chai, mochas and hot chocolate. "
Vivian,a year ago,5,"I am so glad that I finally found the perfect espresso machine.  It has all the features I need and it does not take that much counter space.  Just one press and you can enjoy a cup of quality cappuccino, latte or espresso. Water tank is on the side which is easy to reach when adding water.  You can also easily take it off to fill it up with filtered water from the fridge. Milk tank can be removed to be  stored in your fridge to keep the milk fresh.  It is also very quiet.   Before this purchase, I did a thorough resarch and even tried two different brands.  One is  above $700 and the other under $200.  This is the keeper.  I have zero negative comments about this machine.  Hopefully it will last for several years. "
dugb,a year ago,2,"Really enjoyed this for the short time it worked completely.  Unfortunately within a very short time, the milk steamer started steaming with much less power and I gave up using it.  It was a PIA to clean anyway.  Next, the coffee pod handle metal locking tab snapped while brewing, so now I don't have full pressure in the brewing cycle and it's leaking a lot of water. Of course, Mr. Coffee doesn't sell parts but directs you to other sellers, all of which are sold out of this piece.  So I had to replace it with a non-OEM part which resulted in a poor fit (of course) and still not getting a quality cup.  Bummed, because it was so promising at first! "
Anonymous,4 years ago,5,"Easy to use, quick to clean, and fits under the cabinets on my condo kitchen counter. I've made cappuccinos to my preference (wet); single and double lattes; and macchiatos with just a stain of frothed milk dolloped into shots of sweet, flavorful, aromatic espresso. The only one who's disappointed is my local barista -- she doesn't see me much anymore. "
Jeremy,a year ago,4,"I'm overall very happy with this espresso machine.  My only real complaint is that the milk frothing function is inconsistent.  I don't know if that's because frothing dial is simply not accurate enough or if there is some other reason for it, but there is frequently a drastic difference in the amount of milk/froth applied between drinks. I wish that this had a function to warn when the water reservoir is running low.  It's easy enough to check, but I still forget sometimes and wind up with a partial pull.  It would also be great if it would block using the froth function if the dial was still set to clean mode.  That has caught me a couple times. "
Anon,3 years ago,3,"Worth it for the price we paid (discounted), but mayyybe not at full price, and definitely not for what I've seen at other stores. Usable, does the job, but has some glaring design flaws. + Set it and forget it (unless you're running manual mode - don't forget it then!)+ Removable tanks for water and milk, so you can put the milk in the fridge for the next day+ Floater to warn you of the drip pan level+ Clean cycle runs steam through the milk spout (still needs to be handwashed, but not as frequently)+ Milk apparatus comes apart for easy cleaning -  The filter is difficult to get in and out of place.- There's no extra pressure to end the brew cycle, so the grounds stay soggy- The basket can fall out when knocking grounds loose, even when ""locked"" in place- While there are buttons for latte and cappuccino, you are still expected to dial in the foam level- Nothing to catch the milk if you've forgotten to aim the spout "
Valen,3 years ago,1,"I tried 2 of these units and the first started leaking after just a few days of usage, so I returned it and I got a second one, which it did not leak but after 3 weeks it was pouring right, like it was clogged or it didn’t have enough pressure to push the water through the portafilter, I was already using the single portafilter instead of the double one , because the machine wasn’t building enough pressure, anyway I really gave it a shot but it is just not a well made machine, the preset buttons also don’t work correctly, it does not measure the correct amount so I was always using the manual. I hope others have a better luck with it, thankfully Costco accepted the return without any issues, I have decided to just buy a specialty coffee machine, which so far works great,. "
KDee,4 years ago,2,Great machine but milk reservoir was cracked after one week of use. I contacted Mr Coffee and they do not have replacement parts for this model. I would have purchased the less expensive model that does have replacement parts if I’d have known this. Expensive lesson. 
OaklandSteve,4 years ago,3,"Bought this coffee maker because I wanted an all in one espresso machine. The results were mediocre. It brewed a good cup of coffee... but could be better all around compared to what's out there. 19 Bar pressure? Not really something you need. Space for two cups? Not a thing in my household when we each want different things. Lastly, one pet peeve compared to an old machine I had is that the top of the milk container doesn't snap into the bottom, which could create room for a lot of spills. In the end, it's not for me... but it might be for you! "
TemeculaGus,2 years ago,3,"Good machine for the price. It does what it's suppose to, but it is messy.  The both coffee filters are  not dry after use, it's full of soupy coffee grounds.  When you remove it you have to be very careful or you end up with a soupy mess of coffee grounds..  Called Tech Support and they said is normal.  The other problem is the water tank leaks water from the bottom connection when replacing the water, you end up with water drops on the floor. I recommend if you're okay with coffee grounds mess. "
garden lover,3 years ago,3,"The froth quality is not great and the coffee quality is just fine. The water reservoir/tank capacity is big. You can brew coffee in taller mugs. The coffee and froth are really hot compared to high end espresso makers, if you like your coffees that way that will be a pro for you. Overall you get what you pay for. Decent coffee maker for the price. "
budgetguy,a year ago,4,A water puddle would form on the counter (the tank was not cracked) after a day or so. After clean-up the puddling would repeat every 24+ hours. I called Mr. Coffee customer service & they quickly sent a return mailing label by e-mail. I sent the product back. Within 2 weeks I had received a replacement (new) & it doesn’t leak. The valve so to speak between the tank and the unit looks a little different. I only use it to make expresso for Americano’s & it does that well. Guests will make more advanced beverages. I'll give it a 4 because quality control somewhere along the line did not catch the problem -  though its unlikely that the product would be tested(used) beforehand. Customer service (Mr. Coffee) gets 5 stars 
Srin,3 years ago,5,"I am a hard core coffee connoisseur and always made it with a vintage coffee ""filter"" that I robbed from my mom :) I always resisted any suggestions by others to buy a 'machine'. Also I never liked the coffee from automated coffee makers at work. This one seemed to check all criteria. The price looked worth the risk. As always, Costco had the best deal.  It arrived a bit late but it took few minutes to set up and get started. And the coffee tastes outstandung. It is fast, it is rich. More than everything , belying my fears, it allows me to add slight customizations. I learnt a bit to play with this new toy and each time I change my style a bit and it comes out a bit different. That makes it interesting. I only use the espresso style to the most part. Overall , very very happy with the taste and the speed ! 5 stars for the taste.PS : On the down side, I am drinking more coffee. "
GBCA,2 years ago,5,"After buying a much much more expensive machine that was supposed to produce the best results with ease I was not impressed so returned it.  I then found of all things this Mr Coffee machine for a 5th of the price and it is simply excellent.  Simple to use with great results and you can add more foam or coffee at the touch of a single button.  It is also easy to clean and takes up a much smaller footprint then other machines.  The only thing it doesn't do is grind the coffee beans but the better results and ease of use make that ""inconvenience"" no issue at all. "
Abe121,4 years ago,5,"I really like this product, it gets me the same taste as Starbucks beverages. "
Anonymous,4 years ago,3,I m not a fan of milk frother pulling it out storing and putting it backAlso if pressure was higher would leave coffee less wet and extraction would be optimal 
Krissy1,3 years ago,1,Wanted so bad to love this but it leaks underneath the unit. We put in for a replacement and the replacement leaks too. 
Maveric75033,4 years ago,2,It does the job but the overall quality of the product is low. The milk/foam system is very flimsyThe steam dispenser is loose and Keeps falling into coffee mug; planning to return back 
David,3 years ago,5,I use this to make lattes and it works great. Relatively easy to clean and I love how the milk can be stored in the fridge. Also you can use it a few times before anything needs to be refilled. For the price I think it's great and you can't get anything close to this in this price range 
April D,a year ago,1,"We bought this because of the generally good reviews. I think we’ve owned three in just over 2.5-3 years? The first we purchased outside of Costco. We had that one for maybe a year and a half. It died after I did a round of cleaning. I noticed Costco sold it, so we bought it again bc we were happy with the coffee. 5 or 6 months later it died after the very first cleaning we did. By the way, I follow directions to the tee. So, Costco let us return it and we purchased another bc it was on sale. We REALLY wanted it to work out. Now, about 8 months later, it died again. This time, without any warning, it just stopped making coffee. The water wouldn’t come out. So, while this is a budget friendly item and does make good coffee and froth milk when it works, I cannot recommend it. "
Bob with one O,3 years ago,5,Purchased it for my wife because she was buying mochas every morning.  Her barista tought her how to make mochas. Best investment I have ever made and my wife loves it. 
AtlFolks,3 years ago,4,"Pros - it’s semi-automatic; you get a good latte or cappuccino at the touch of a button. It’s also a nice space-saver in the kitchen Cons - It’s semi-automatic. If you want to froth milk a certain way, or go for a riseretto or longio shot; better stick with something more manual. "
Kaihekoa,3 years ago,5,"This is a great, entry-level home espresso machine. It works well, is not too hard to figure out, and will save our household a lot of money in the long run. Much appreciation to Costco for the recent holiday sale on this -- it's a steal for $130 "
VASAM,3 years ago,1,The machine came defective and when I called the warranty department they required that the machine be sent back first before a replacement is sent. The machine will be going back to Costco. I have owned many espresso machines in this one I do not recommend at all. 
AGumer,3 years ago,5,I did a ton of research before purchasing this machine and i am very happy with the purchase. It extracts great flavor and makes solid drinks. 
Col Forbin,2 years ago,1,"The pump failed and hot water began spewing out the bottom. If it failed a few days later, I would have been out of luck. I'm getting a replacement from Mr. Coffee but don't expect the new one to last too long. Reviews of this item on other sites show this is a common issue "
kdwights,3 years ago,5,"This machine makes excellent espresso drinks and is special since it can make cappuccino and latte drinks in one button, one step process since it froths the milk as part of one operation. "
Lauren91,4 years ago,3,"I liked the simple to use design and it worked great but it made the espresso beans that I've used with a AeroPress and loved, taste really bitter. I also wasn't a fan of how wet the grounds stayed it made it difficult too clean after uses. "
Grandma Mouse,3 years ago,4,"This is my first time using a ""machine"" for fancy coffee.  Some reviews say it is easy to clean,  I disagree- though if you have the time its ok.  The filter ""cup"" - where you put the coffee- doesn't fully drain so when you firmly turn the handle to drop it out of the unit you generally slop wet grounds out. Remembering to place a small plate on the coffee cup shelf keeps the  mess from going into the bottom of the unit which is also a bit of a challenge to clean.  My sister has the same unit and agrees about the cleaning.  I do love the coffees - so if you don't mind managing it and and milk container- go for it.  I'm retired.  If you wanted a quick cup to get out the door with this is not your unit. "
Robb,3 years ago,4,"Simple to use, pretty easy to clean. It would be nice if there was a way to brew a regular cup of coffee though. "
coffeelover,3 years ago,1,"There’s a strange plastic taste that I can’t get rid of. I’ve cleaned the machine with vinegar and rinsed off all the pieces and I’ve tried using it about four times, but can’t bare to waste any more espresso. "
Nmdude,2 years ago,1,Used once and it leaked from the bottom of unit. Spoke with Mr Coffee rep they said I had to ship it back to them and woukd take an additional 3 weeks to receive replacement or just take it back to Costco so returned to Costco. Would not purchase again. 
John,3 years ago,4,Bought Mr. Coffee One-touch in Dec 2020 and it worked great from the start. Easy to use and easy to clean. Onlky drawback is getting grounds out of the porta-filter with out making a mess. Lattes and espressos are good and consistancy depends on the proper amount of coffee and pressure tamping it down. 
Dung,11 months ago,1,"I am so frustrated. I have just got this one last week (3rd one). And it's happening again. No Foam. Of course I have a right to return and get another one, but I am so embarrassing to return too many times. "
Anna,4 years ago,5,"I'm really happy with my purchase of the One-Touch CoffeeHouse. It's easy to clean, easy to set up, and unlike traditional cappuccino machines, you can hit a button and walk away and it'll make the perfect cappuccino or latte for you. "
John S,3 years ago,5,"I absolutely love this espresso machine.  When my wife and I were in Italy several years ago I fell in love with Italian coffee and in particular espresso's and Macchiato's.  This Mr. Coffee machine is so easy to use and clean.  Love the fact that the leftover milk is in a container and can be immediately stored in the fridge after use.  Using this machine is a no-brainer.  Very user friendly and cleans so easily.  My only complaint was the cheap plastic tamper that came with it.  I ordered a good heavy-duty one online and it works great.  If you are looking for a great machine at a reasonable price, I would definitely recommend the Mr. Coffee One-Touch Espresso Machine.  I look forward to every morning now and my home-made macchiato's. "
ManhattanMike,3 years ago,1,The seal between the water reservoir and the unit base is defective.  With water in the reservoir it just leaks out between reservoir and base. VERY DISAPPOINTNG for the Mr. Coffee Brand!! 
NoPalletsPlease,4 years ago,4,"Great price for a semi-automatic machine. I haven’t been able to truly replicate my coffee shop drinks but I think that’s on me, not the machine. Still experimenting with different coffees and grinds so hopefully we’ll get there. "
tkkkk,3 years ago,5,Friend has a Krups Semi-Automatic but that was out of my price range. Excellent machine for the price. Seem built well and looks great in the kitchen! 4 weeks into use as I'm writing this. Love it. Highly recommend. 
Charlton,4 years ago,1,The buttons don’t work that great. I have to hit it about ten times for it to work. 
richie,2 years ago,2,"Was pretty happy for its easiness of use, flexibility to control the volume of froth and expresso. After 6 months of usage, the pump just became weak and then stopped. "
Rosie13,2 years ago,4,"I love my new Mr. Coffee Espresso, Cappuccino and Latte machine!! It's super easy to use. I just buy Cafe Bustelo which is an espresso grind. Only one drawback and that is that the machine sometimes leaks water, and I have to dry my countertop. Maybe it's user error, IDK, but it's a small price to pay for my own homemade coffees!! "
Kevin,a year ago,3,"This machine does what it's supposed to do.  The espresso maker portion works excellent.  The problem is that it draws in milk, steams it and discharges it into your cup.  Works great after it's been fully disassembled, soaked, and cleaned.  I make one Latte/day for my wife and I can get 2 days' between deep cleaning or the dried (nonfat) milk clogs the system and it doesn't work.  Works great if you make 8 Lattes in a row, but not 1/day. "
Aubrey,3 years ago,1,this espresso machine randomly spits water out of the bottom so i have to make sure i keep the plug far from the machine so it doesnt electricute me when i plug it in 
TechGuy011011,3 years ago,1,"I must have received a defective unit, because water leaked around the coffee pod handle.  It first wouldn't lock because it felt like the gasket was too tight or thick.  When forced to that lock position it still leaked water.  The unit looked brand new, not a suspected return, so I suspect poor quality control. "
Theavy,7 months ago,1,Very disappointed. The espresso stopped dripping and the water tank leaked a week into using it! 
Ruby Kevala,2 years ago,4,"Really like this machine. The price point can't be beat compared to other fully automatic machines out there. Great crema and flavor if you prepare your grounds properly. Autonomy if you want it over amount of milk and froth if you want it. When I first got it, there was a problem (which I read about before purchasing) with water leaking from under the machine. I ended up fixing it by reaching into the water tank and grabbing the little o-ring on the spring-loaded part of the water outlet and snugging it up toward the top of that spring-loaded valve. Seems to have fixed the problem so far! I only detracted one star due to one thing: the leftover puck after brewing is often still waterlogged, so it seems that 19 bars of pressure may not be quite that. Overall, I feel this machine can't be beat for the pricing, especially for a first automatic machine. "
Tony,2 years ago,1,"I don't know if I got a defective model or if I was using it wrong. Regardless of serving size I selected, the machine only dispersed a 1/4 cup beverage. Worse than that was customer service. I called the product support line and got a person who seem to be working for a human resources company. He gave me an email address for support and a few days later, I got an email telling me they couldn't help me. I returned the unit. "
Janice,3 years ago,4,A little noisy but works great. 
Lili,2 years ago,1,"I bought it because i saw it at my  friend's house, it work great for about a week, at the same time my friends stops working to . "
A1Fresnotary,3 years ago,3,It is a gift for my daughter and she says it is difficult to get it to make the right amount of coffee 
HoustonDAD,3 years ago,4,"Good price but having to clean up the milk side instead of just a plain steaming wand made me swap it out for the DeLonghi machine. I didn’t regret that choice, this one is too complicated and requires too much cleanup although I got it at a good price "
Janos Marias,3 years ago,4,I think the machine is overall a good buy and provides a good espresso or latte. Espresso has a nice crema. The biggest “issue” I have with it is you can’t set it to make the drink when it heats up. You have to press a button to start the warm up process and it requires you press the button again when it’s ready. If you wait too long it will turn off and you have to start all over. It is otherwise fairly easy to use and it’s nice to be able to take the milk container off and put it directly in the fridge although I don’t recommend that for long-term storage since the milk spoils faster in it. It comes with two cute espresso mugs. I got it on sale - 179. For the money it is a great espresso maker. 
Joanne,3 years ago,4,"I am enjoying the machine. I really like lattes but won't pay the price to buy them. The first day I spent an hour and a couple of drinks perfecting the operation of the machine. Today was the second day using, and it was easier.  Great tasting drink! "
Harvest_ripe,3 years ago,5,"Was skeptical when bought it during holiday sale , one of the best purchases we’ve made. We wanted an espresso machine but most of them were too complicated with multi function  , over priced, some features weren’t even necessary.  This is exactly what we wanted and would highly recommend for anybody who’s looking for a simple espresso machine that does an excellent job. "
LLCH,3 years ago,5,"I was a little wary of buying this espresso maker because the cost was so low.  However, it is proving to be a powerful machine that gives me the option of making many different coffees.  My only worry is that the milk frothing unit is taken on and off every time I am finish making a coffee and I worry that it may break at some point.  But, for now it is working like a champ.  I would definitely recommend this machine if you want a low cost option for an espresso machine.  Love, Love, Love it. "
Neil,3 years ago,1,"The internal pump appears to be broken, initial setup failed to eject water from either spout. Pretty Disappointing after a 15-day wait for shipment. "
Anh T,3 years ago,5,I bought this machine because I am stuck at home during Covid.  At first it wasn't working because the machine was upside down when gift wrap.  Likely air pockets.  This is my first espresso machine and to me it makes really good coffee.  Especially using it with a grinder.  Definitely worth the money to me because 3 persons have been using for about 2 years now. 
ExCostcoFan,3 years ago,1,"Never knew I will be writing a review saying Costco’s service being horrible. Would have given zero if that was an optionI ordered a Mr. Coffee espresso machine that was on a sale this thanksgiving but the item came broken. I went to Costco warehouse thinking that they can order a replacement for me, but it turns out they can’t do that. The Costco employee told me that I can return the item at the warehouse, get full refund and call the customer care to get a replacement at the same price I bought the item at. So I went with it - returned the item and called the customer care the next day. The customer care employee now tells me that I should have returned the item through customer care or online for a replacement. Now the item cannot be “replaced” and I will have to pay the full price on that. Such a horrible experience! Why would you accept a return in the warehouse if the customer can’t order a replacement? And, why can’t you order a replacement through customer care of the customer has the return receipt with all details on it? The worst thing - all directions were given by Costco’s own employees "
Kobba,4 months ago,2,"First, we absolutely loved this machine and enjoyed so much the latte and cappuccino! It was amazing by all means until it completely stopped working suddenly after only  few months since I bought it. Basically, it completely shout down and no light would turn on!We are very frustrated and expected it to last long given its price range. I am positive that there is a manufacturing defect so please Mr coffee review your product carefully and fix this issue cause we really love your products. "
cheesemonger,3 years ago,5,Enjoying this maker. Having latte and espresso everyday. As tasty as any shop. 
AndyAllon,3 years ago,5,Easy to operate. Professional quality. 
Kev NC,3 years ago,4,Good quality and easy to use 
Nel04,2 years ago,4,"Great for espresso, but a little time consuming for lattes with the cleaning process.  I was looking for an affordable semi-automatic espresso maker and this fit the bill.  I had the older version of this one for 5 years before it died so I needed something new.  I couldn't beat Costco's price (as usual!) I really only use the machine for espresso which I give 5 stars, if I used it for lattes or cappuccinos it would be really time consuming with the cleaning process after every use - I think I would prefer just a steam wand instead of a machine that sucks in the milk. "
trivo6k,3 years ago,2,"1) This 19-bar coffee machine is weaker than the 15-bar Delonghi machine I have, even my Delonghi is two-year old and this one is new. 2) I use very fine grinded coffee to produce the strongest black expresso possible: the old 15-bar Delonghi gives out coffee slowly (but it did) and this One-touch 19-bar machine stops after giving out some very little coffee, all the leds are then blinking. If you press the expresso button again, water is leaking from the bottom. I guess It cannot handle the pressure built up internally due to fine-grinded coffee as the Delonghi did. "
Véronique,2 years ago,5,"Great expresso maker! it is easy to operate, easy to wash and makes delicious coffee  and cappuccino. I don’t like to put too much milk in my cappuccino, so I just put the amount of milk I want in the reservoir. The frothing dingy works very well. Most of the time I do a double expresso and add a bit of cream. For being so much cheaper than other makers, it really doesn’t look cheap at all, doesn’t take a lot of space, and feel very sturdy. I highly recommend it. "
Harish,5 months ago,4,I have been using the Mr. Coffee One-Touch CoffeeHouse Espresso and Cappuccino Machine for about a week now. It makes decent espresso and cappuccino. Wish there was a way to adjust the coffee/milk ratio in the auto mode. I have not tried the Latte yet. The machine seems to leak a bit. I find the tray below cupholder gets filled up frequently. Not sure if this is the way it is expected to work. I still miss the simple  Mr.Coffee machine with built in milk frother ... 
Liz H,2 years ago,4,"This machine makes it fun to make coffee in the morning! Our Keurig pooped out, so we decided to try this. Considering we were already using the reusable k-cups to cut down on waste and save money, this was a relatively easy switch to make. We had been using a separate frother for our coffee, so it's extra nice to have a machine with a steamer in it. We are a dairy free household and this machine does great with oat milk. Mr. Coffee also makes a hotter cup of coffee than our Keurig did. So that was a pleasent surprise. I gave this a 4/5 only because mastering making coffee did a require a slight learning curve (I will say it would've been easier to master if my partner hadn't thrown away the instructions with the box!). "
tweek,2 years ago,5,"I have been using this everyday for the past year and it has held up great. It makes a great latte every time no matter what type of milk you use. Almond milk is more difficult to froth, but you can still a nice latte with this machine. 2% Milk foams up nicely. I rarely write reviews, but I really have been impressed with the ease and consistent quality of the coffee, even after a year of significant use. I'll be buying another when I wear this one out. "
happy user,3 years ago,3,I wanted to really like this machine and there are several things I do. It makes a  beautiful latte while l watch and makes another cup fairly quickly. The coffee holder can only handle one scoop of ground coffee and I can't get it strong enough to suit my taste. The automatic milk frother is a great idea and is easy to use once you get the spouts positioned correctly. Instuctions say you ca leave it in  the refridgerrator but the reality is the miilk sours quickly and takes more time to clean than it would have to froth the milk. Getting it on an off is also tricky with a  small plastic clip I can feel won't last long.  This machine would be great for someone who has trouble frothing their own milk and wants to watch their coffee being made.  I'd rather have a stronger cup of coffee and froth my own milk for a much easier clean up. 
Honest Abe,a year ago,3,"The unit is easy to set up and use.  Quick-start & manual guidelines are clearly written.The twist-lock receptacle to load the grounds is recessed, rather than extending down like many machines.  It makes it a bit more difficult to locate and twist lock the porta-filter - your aim gets better with repetition.  The separate milk froth attachment is easy to use, clean and refrigerate for next time.  Unfortunately, the espresso produced is weaker-tasting than I expect, even on manual using finest grind espresso beans (which the machine handles with no problem). "
Gator J,2 years ago,5,"We have had the Espresso and Cappuccino Machine for 4 days now. Before deciding on this one we had looked at several automatic ones, but they all said dark roast beans should not be used. This one recommends using the dark roast beans. We were able to find this unit on sale and decided to give it a try. Pros: 1. You can use dark roast beans, 2. The unit does support the Easy Serving Espresso pods (for an easier clean up), 3) Large milk and water tanks, 4) Easy to remove milk tank for storage in the refrigerator, & 5) Easy & quick clean up. Cons: 1) No LCD screen for trouble shooting (usually not enough milk or water), 2) The Milk Froth Control Level Knob feels cheap (but it does work). Overall the machine works well, and the beverages are hot. The machine is not much to look at, but it is practical and works as advertised. While it's appearance will not wow your friends, the beverages it produces will. It does a great job with the froth for the Lattes. It will pay for itself in no time if you use it to replace the trip to your local coffee shop. "
Jerry Adair,3 years ago,4,"Essentially a very good machine with one serious design issue and that is.....attaching the frothing container to its appropriate position.  Two words, extremely difficult.   My wife uses it every morning and it's always a problem getting it situated correctly.  As far as performance is concerned the lattes are perfect.  The maker is a very attractive design and fits well in our kitchen.  Except for the frothing vessel this is a 5 Star machine. "
Gmac,3 years ago,2,This machine makes regular coffee- it doesn’t make anything resembling espresso.   Could be why it isn’t called Mr Espresso..... 
Mtroost,4 years ago,5,So easy to use! The automatic setting for Latte and Cappuccino works well. I use the manual so I can put a triple or quadruple shot in mine. Quick and simple to clean. ❤️ Taste is great! 
Elaine,3 years ago,4,I have been using Mr. Coffee machines for long time. I like this one touch. It makes latte and cappuccino easily. But I hate the stupid design of filter handle. The inside filter drops out every time when I dump used coffee no matter where I turn the stopper of filter. I missed the filter handle design of Mr. Coffee 4-Cup Steam Espresso System with Milk Frother which has a flipper on handle that makes dumping coffee easily. 
Anonymous,4 years ago,4,This is a great machine the only downside is it's too loud to make coffee without waking up my wife and daughter. 
Venky,2 years ago,4,"Good product for the price. Few nuances come with it… need to wait for it to brew, then need to pull the milk container each time if you need to refill. "
Papo Jim,8 months ago,2,This is the 2nd one we have bought and both stopped working after a few months even though we were very careful in cleaning and not abusing. 
Rob T,2 years ago,4,Works well for a good starter espresso machine. Makes good lattes and cappuccinos and is easy to use.  Great value for the price-point. 
homer,3 years ago,4,"Replaced a DeLonghi that worked well for many years and finally died.  I am very pleased with this as a replacement.  FIrst and foremost, it's much quieter.  The frother on the DeLonghi would wake the entire neighborhood.  This one is far from silent, but does not have the high-pitched shrill we had become accustomed to.  The second advantage is the automated nature of the frothing.  Rather than standing there to tend to the frothing, I can start the latte function and it will make the coffee then the milk completely unattended.  One star deductions for two reasons: The first unit we received did not work.  It ran through the process but never pulled in any water.  Wasted hours trying to figure it out, then research the problem and finally have it replaced.  Quality control needs to be better.  Secondly, you cannot customize the size for a large cup.  If you like a ""venti"" size as I do, you'll need to press the button then when it's done come back and press it again to fill your cup.  This is disappointing but still better than standing there holding the cup of milk up to the frother as with the prior unit.  Overall, very happy with this purchase. "
gadgetfreak,3 years ago,5,"This is a great entry level machine. It takes ese pods which makes less mess. The milk frother works  well. Overall it produces good espresso drinks. We also use it for making hot chocolate.  The machine  built components has lot of plastic and thus it is light weight. While inserting  Portafilter, whole machine moves. Kinda irritating but not a huge deal for low price. Btw we bought it at discounted price. "
Khaled,2 years ago,3,"Machine is working, but to me it’s looks cheap because it’s made from plastic also got the plastic smell, so I returned "
Forrests mom,3 years ago,3,"One of my favorite Mr. Coffee espresso machines was an older model that lasted a few years but gave out from lack of pressure.  This more modern version has automatic features and lots of pressure, but you have less control over the end product and froth comes out first and seems to end up all over the place.   I returned it to Costco through delivery pick up and they refunded my account by the next day! "
Monique,2 years ago,5,Loving it so far.....seriously froths! 
Bhav,2 years ago,1,Really wanted to like it but it leaks from underneath the unit. Leaked all over my counter. Did some research looks like it’s a common issue. If it doesn’t happen initially it will happen eventually. 
Happy Camper,3 years ago,4,This is my first espresso machine. So I have nothing to compare it with but I have not had any problems with it so far. Everything is working well so far. It was less expensive than many others that I looked at so I decided to try this one before spending many hundreds or thousands of dollars on a machine that probably would have been nothing more than a status symbol. 
Paul,2 years ago,4,"Tightly packaged for shipment. The unit is very easy to use with a very light touch of any of the buttons. Not nearly as noisy as many reviewers stats. There is a slight perceptible pump rhythmic best during the cleaning cycle. But, it does not take more than a minute for this function.A good alternative option for a beginner or even novice home barista. "
Anonymous,4 years ago,5,Easy to use and does the trick. Less finicky than a $700 machine I had to return. Recommend. 
FnD S,a year ago,4,Great for starting out! Easy to use and clean. Price was wonderful to try a machine at home and we are very happy with this one. I drink a quad coffee though so I make a double espresso then a latte or whatever I’m making. Pushing the pull to three shots is a bit far but for the money and time it works for me. 
Ranjit,3 years ago,4,"The metal filter that is used with the portafilter has a notch that doesn't work most of the time making cleaning it (dumping the grounds) a problem.  Other than that, I like the auto features.  I have a DeLonghi which has a plastic pop up that will hold the filter in place for clean ups and it works great. "
Coffeeman,2 years ago,3,"The first one we had failed almost right after the warranty. Costco replaced that one, however the second one had a leaky reservoir tank and left our counters covered in water. That being said for the time we had the first one it was easy to use, coffee quality was good and generally had no major complainst. "
Anton,3 years ago,4,"This is decent espresso machine for the buck. Pluses: easy, quieter than comparable machines like Cuisinart EM-200, decent espresso, very nice frothing. It is a separate container easily detached and easy to clean - truly an advantage. Easy one touch selections. Minuses: To my taste the coffee was not so rich as it should be in espresso. I chose to replace the default basket with a metal one I had left from my EM-200 and the taste improved. Consistent with other reviews, I have to hold the whole machine with my left hand while plugging and tightening the coffee basket but this is the least of my concerns. Overall, I was satisfied by the product. If there was me thing I could choose to fix would be the pressure bars or something to squeeze more flavor into the coffee. "
Sohil,a year ago,1,"Bought this, tried to work with it hours and hours, each time a new problem, took me one week to finally connect with customer service, they told me the machine is bad.  Asked me to return the machine before replacement arrives.  Too many problems with this machine, better to stay away from it. "
Coffee Drinker,2 years ago,1,"Returning to Costco. The machine leaks water profusely onto the counter. On the flip side: espresso produced was very good, packaging and finish is superb, great instructions. But I can’t cave the machine constantly leaking water onto the counter. It’s possible this was just a one off. "
Linda,9 months ago,5,"I love Mr. Coffee Espresso - I use the clean option after each use. Also, periodically flush the system with White Vinegar and water to keep the clean and healthy and you should have years of service. My last Mr. Coffee last over 3 years. "
Alejopatan,2 years ago,5,"We use this coffee maker 4-5 times a day at work. We have 4 of them and they are great. Some of these are 3 years old and still working fine. Can’t complain, I found them a better value than other machines that cost 10X more. "
Loraleigh,2 years ago,1,It worked fine for 1 year and then just over 1 year of having it - stoped pushing water through anymore. We cleaned it daily after use so not sure what went wrong. I would be reluctant to buy another Mr Coffee again. 
edrod05,3 years ago,1,I just received my package and instead of being this new model I received a box with a brand new old model what is the deal with Costco ? 
elin,2 years ago,1,"I was really looking forward to having an espresso machine so I decided to purchase this one when it was on sale. the handle is super hard to lock in, it leaks once its making the espresso  I will be return it "
SSRN,2 years ago,1,Too expensive for the Poor quality. Maintenance - too much work. Advertised as stainless steel but parts are mostly plastic. Looks good but product not worth the price. It was returned to Costco. 
Coffeer,a year ago,3,"the pump is not powerful enough which leads to the machine fail making espresso. Also, the milk container is not well designed, hard to attach and also the extension tube is poorly designed. "
Savi,3 years ago,5,This machine makes surprisingly good espresso. -said my espresso snobbish better half!  He was planning to buy a $4k machine to suit his style but was really happy with this machine. 
Christopher,3 years ago,5,"Well with every penny.  I don’t know why someone would spend $1000+ for an espresso machine when you could buy this one at a fraction of the cost.  Works perfectly, well designed. "
Richard B,3 years ago,5,"Only had this since Jan. 5th 2021 but so far so good as they say. Seems sturdy enough that with reasonable care should last a good while, time will tell. I love the lattes this makes, and Americanos are good as well. I'm not an espresso connoisseur but that drink seems fine to me.I like that you can do a one touch large latte and then add extra milk or coffee with the manual controls. And the option to do your coffee manually just as you wish is very nice.I would buy this again. "
Rob R,a year ago,5,"This is my second go around with the Mr Coffee 3 in 1 maker. It comes through at a 5 with all 3. No complaints, I will continue to enjoy my espresso, latte and cappuccino. "
Dominick,3 years ago,3,The milk reservoir is tricky to connect - the alignment has to be perfect and its clunky and doesn't stop drawing milk when the reservoir is empty. Otherwise a good value 
Amber,2 years ago,1,"How disappointing. The frothing would not stop. Tried multiple times and different settings, no change. The water chamber also leaked. Love the Costco return policy. "
Edgar in Austin,2 years ago,4,I have probably had 20 or 25 double lattes since Christmas.  Another 25 or so for the family.  Do the math on that and you quickly see the value of this machine. 
Joan,3 years ago,3,"Too many interlocking parts,  I have a feeling will break in time, I have a tall cup and mug that doesn't fit even when I remove the drip tray, the double pod doesn't hold enough grounds, I have to make another batch, the grounds are runny and the pod falls in the trash,the milk container has a skinny section which is hard to clean, I seem to have to babysit this more than saving time, I think I'll go back to my old, cheap, Mr. Coffee espresso machine, that worked great for me. "
Ashutosh,3 years ago,3,"Hard to fit two cups and you can only use two cups for expresso but not for cappuccino or latte. But otherwise great machine, nice and smooth coffee. "
Runningman,3 years ago,5,Make sure to clean the frothing wand frequently. Overall quality and dependability you’d expect from Mr.Coffee. Hard to beat the old reliables. 
Frank,3 years ago,5,Makes great espresso with excellent crema at a very affordable price. I’ve owned several espresso machines over the years and this is the best! 
Omar V,a year ago,5,"One of the best purchases i have made at Costco.  Easy to use, practical, easy clan up, and did I mention, great lattes and cappuccinos. "
Socky,2 years ago,2,I couldn't control the froth. Always more than I wanted. Milk frother is a big negative. the entire machine is flimsy. made of plastic. 
Hv11,2 years ago,3,Ideally it’s a great idea! But it is a bit loud and we felt like it got louder the week after we bought it. We ended up returning it. 
CJ B,3 years ago,5,Love this machine! The last version we had lasted 3 years of daily use. I'm sure this one will do just as good if not better. 
Yori,3 years ago,5,"Great espresso and cappuccino machine so far. It has easy to setups, use on a daily basis, and clean. Definitely recommend. "
MK NorCal,2 years ago,4,Makes great espresso and steams milk nicely. Milk container needs to be lined up just right to get it to lock in place. 
mikeminyard,2 years ago,5,"This makes a very good latte. Espresso coffe is a requirement, as it is not strong enough if using a regular grind. "
Anonymous,2 years ago,1,"The portafilter is very hard to rotate into the working position, you have to have very strong arm to do it. "
Julia,3 years ago,1,"Tried several espresso coffee brands, still produced weak flavor. Didn’t heat up, was warm, not hot. "
Mela calugday,3 years ago,4,Its a great espresso maker and very convenient... nice to have if your a espresso or coffee lover 
Kolyai,2 years ago,2,"the pump wouldn't push the water through coffee well, coffee grinds would stay soaky with water "
Chris n Riss,3 years ago,5,Consistently good coffee. Easy to clean and operate. Wondering why we didn’t buy this earlier. 
Japanese maple lover,2 years ago,5,It’s a perfect espresso machine with the best price! I hope it will last for a long time. 
Sam M,11 months ago,4,Excellent One-Touch CoffeeHouse Espresso and Cappuccino Machine. Works very good. 
Podavis,3 years ago,1,Having trouble with the coffee holder. It doesn’t sit properly to make coffee 
Rudy,3 years ago,1,The handle was super stiff and stuck before being in locked position. 
rmgrace,a year ago,1,it was very hard to screw the handle with the coffeeand then it broke 
Shopper x,3 years ago,1,The machine was delivered broken. The water tank was cracked. 
Fayesplace,3 years ago,5,I love this machine. The expresso is great as well as the frother. 
Chris 7,a year ago,1,"expresso was very weak , even with double strength. ret "
Andy,3 years ago,5,"It's my first cappuccino latte machine, I love it. "
Crystal,3 years ago,4,Works very well. The froth is perfect every time. 
Paul,2 years ago,2,"Makes a good espresso,  that is all. "
Laura,3 years ago,5,Easy to use and compact. 
Lunaception,2 years ago,1,The pumped stopped working after 8 months. Manufacturers make appliances as cheaply as possibly. This is my 3rd type of espresso machine. Other brands have the same issue. Pump gives out every time. I’m done buying these coffee makers. Coffee tastes like soap. Pathetic when an appliance can’t even make it a year. Way to go Mr. Coffee. (Rolls eyes) 
happy4ever,3 years ago,4,"Pros: *Good machine for the price, I got it on sale only $140 delivered.  And bought it from Costco         * Recoup your cost in less than a month comparing to making trip to Starbucks especially in the pandemic time Cons: * Wait for machine to warm up about 3 minutes when first turned on           * Kinda hard to lock the Milk reservoir in place, after a while a few tries youwill get used to it Other than these cons things, I would go for it "
Blitz,2 years ago,5,Awesome coffee maker 
Russ,2 years ago,1,"I bought this coffee maker in February, and it has been working perfectly for 5 months. Fast forward the past 2 weeks, the coffee maker has been making TERRIBLE coffee. The milk further and the coffee filter have stopped working. I tried cleaning all the parts with water, and still no change. The coffee has some white powdery substance which I think looks like powdered milk and black coffee powder particles, the stench from the coffee is terrible. "
Jerry,3 years ago,4,"It makes a good cup of coffee but don't plan on making one if the rest of your family is asleep.  The steamer is extremely loud!  Other than it being noisy, it works well so far.  Only about a dozen cups in so we'll see how durable it is.  Hopefully it lasts longer than the much more expensive one we bought last year. "
Rick,3 years ago,5,"Espresso coffee on par with professional machines, without the price tag. I’ve had the previous generation of espresso Mr Coffee without the automatic frother that it’s still running well 8 years later. Bought this one because of the automatic frother. This one comes with a professional 19 psi pump and has the pressure release that avoids the dripping after the coffee is served, just like some of the most expensive professional machines. "
Mark,3 years ago,4,"Have used for about two months. It prepares the espresso very good. It is semi-automated for the coffee end preparing Latte, Cappuccino and/or espresso, in 1 portion or 2 portions.The milk frothing is semiautomated for froth consistency, clean function and inputs to Cappuccino and Latte. Also has manual functions. Only drawback is the frothing - its ok-- but not the best. Otherwise - I like the machine. Easy to clean and so far reliable. "
Shawn,3 years ago,2,The handle on the milk frothed is made of very cheap plastic and broke within the first week. I emailed Mr. Coffee and have not received a response.  It does do a good job of making drinks. The next time I purchase a machine like this it will be in a brick and mortar store where I can fully inspect the product. 
chickory,2 years ago,5,I bought this for my husband for Christmas 2021.  He absolutely loves it and I get a lot of benefit out of it also! I was so happy to find a machine like this that most seemed to really like and is a reasonable price.  It is easy for him to use and makes really great espressos and lattes.  It also meant a lot to me to buy a product from Costco where they really stand behind their products. I absolutely would recommend this to others. 
Randy,2 years ago,2,Unfortunately this machine didn't come remotely close to meeting expectations. Water pools up in the filter basket and doesn't produce a full size cup of espresso. I can't even judge the quality of the cup of espresso because I am not even sure the machine is making it properly. The machine randomly leaks lots of water all over the counter and underneath the machine when not in use. The water reservoir and milk container are difficult to to put in and out and feels like they will easily break. The milk container is especially difficult so much so that I don't even want to make cappuccino anymore and that was the reason for purchasing the machine in the first place.I really wanted to like this machine and still do want to so I am going to continue for a little longer to find some workable solutions. At this point I would not recommend this machine at all. 
CostoFan,3 years ago,5,"This machine  great for the price.Pros: Latte looks and tastes good. Milk froth works well.Cons: Water leaks sometimes. Still have to figure out what makes it leak sometime, not all the time. I just take the remaining water out now and don't leave it overnight.  Puck is not ""dry"". I've stopped worrying about that and enjoy the taste. Inserting the milk container needs getting used to. Overall I'm very happy with the purchase! "
E Cruz,a year ago,5,I had a $800 espresso machine in my future home wish list. This machine checked all the boxes! It had the automatic froth dispenser to make either a cappuccino or latte. It’s been easy to clean too! I thought it would be a pain to empty the grounds for multiple shots of espresso but it’s not bad. I just think of how rich my coffee is and how much it’s worth it. We’ve used the machine every day for the past 3 weeks. 
Jane Doe,3 years ago,1,It was delivered without a main component. Had to return it. 
canamom,3 years ago,5,"I have been wanting an espresso machine for home but didn't want to pay the horrendous prices of them.  I saw this machine by a fluke when searching them on Costco's website.  Ordered it and it came very timely.  Followed the setup instructions, made a couple of cups to get ""my"" settings and haven't looked back!  This will pay off in no time!  GREAT little espresso machine for home use.  So happy I found this!!! "
Carebear,2 years ago,5,Purchased as a Christmas gift. The recipients absolutely love it! They can make some fancy coffee or a regular cup of joe with ease. The attached frothed is definitely a bonus that can be removed and stored in the frig if there is leftover dairy. They also enjoyed that it doesn’t take up much counter space. They only thing that could be better is that it’s a bit on the noisy side but not a deal breaker 
Margaret,3 years ago,3,"I purchased this a couple of weeks ago and have mixed review. It makes a great espresso, latte and cappuccino. I have a difficult time attaching the milk unit.  It just won't go in. I have troubleshoot the problem and watched a video.  I still have problems.  It looks like I'm not the only one.  My fear is that  the parts look very flimsy and might break. I would sort of recommend this.  Hope it last! "
Pink,2 years ago,3,"I guess I should have read on Google first the instructions on how to operate and clean. You’d have to really only like expresso/ cappuccino because it’s not just “one-touch” to prepare. And, it’s not meant to make just regular coffee. "
Stephen G,2 years ago,5,"There's so many of these in the market but I'm super glad I went with this one. Very easy to use and not challenging to clean.  I figured setting it up, making the coffee, and cleaning it out is still quicker than going through a Starbucks drive thru, besides easier on your wallet.  I use Colombian fine grind.  the $220 price costco has is not bad, however if you can find it on sale, such a steal! "
Hi a,3 years ago,5,"This is a very simple to use, straight forward espresso machine. It accommodates to a beginner level learner of espresso with the pre programmed buttons and the more advance espresso drinker, with the manual buttons. You can stylize any type of repairs so drink. It is the prefect size, not too big. It’s about the size of a coffee maker. It’s easy to clean and set up. Would recommend "
customer5525,2 years ago,5,The cappuccino tastes awesome and we save a ton of money making our coffee ourselves every day. When we first set up the machine it was leaking water all over the countertop after we made the coffee. For some reason it no longer leaks. I push the water container into the bottom very tightly and now it works perfectly. I do empty the water container at the end of the day. 
LISA,3 years ago,5,This espresso and cappuccino machine is absolutely superb! Really enjoy my coffee time every day while WFH now. So easy to use and make great coffee latte and espresso. 
Mati,3 years ago,3,The coffee machine works normally but does not meet my personal expectations. 
Emmanuel,3 years ago,5,"Obviously it’s more work than your regular drip coffee maker, but if you enjoy espresso as much as I do, then this little guy is well worth the price. If you are the type of person that needs instant gratification, this is not for you. The set up and clean up can seam like too much work for some, but I personally enjoy the work it takes to enjoy a double shot of espresso. "
Lana,2 years ago,2,It makes very little amount of coffee. I have to fill up fresh ground coffee to make a full cup. I have to add espresso shot to mocha in order to taste any coffee 
John,2 years ago,4,"Overall pleased with the unit though the foam/clean knob is pretty ""spongy"" as others have noted, which gives less control on foam amount than I'd like. Yes, the steaming feature is louder than other espresso machines I have used but it's not a deal breaker by any means! Being able to manually add more espresso (or milk) to squeeze a bit more out of a serving is a plus. "
Scheherezade,3 years ago,5,"I bought this a few days ago to replace my Nespresso machine. Very easy to use, makes great lattes and cappuccinos. The milk froth is not as smooth and creamy as with other high end machines such as Breville or DeLonghi, but it comes out just as hot. This machine is great for someone who does not want to make a big splurge but still wants delicious cafe-style drinks! "
Anon,4 months ago,4,"over all good product so far, but seems a little delicate in the milk and water container. Auto cleaning seems to work well, but creates steam all around the dispenser making it wet and requiring to wipe off. Milk container could be bigger, it hardly serves 3 cups before requiring refill.The plastic spoon to measure and press coffee feels flimsy and cheap. "
Aspen,2 years ago,4,It’s great for the price. We’ve enjoyed various drinks almost daily since purchase. The only reason for not giving it a 5 star rating is that turning the porta filter onto the brew head was very difficult. We thought we would break the entire machine the first time we forced it on. We still have to brace the machine to turn it but getting a bit easier with use. 
Beachdudes,2 years ago,3,"Overall ok, but I do not think the pressure is working correctly.  No matter what grind I use, there is always water left in the bowl and I have taken the bowl apart to clean the filters, still same results. Does not make an espresso strong coffee due to the lack of pressure.  Probably going back to Costco, not sure yet. Purchased mid December 2021. "
Anna,3 years ago,1,"What is the difference between this machine and the one pictured in Mrs Coffe official website. The writing is in white color here and black in their website, and the size is different as well. Can you please explain "
Bekah,3 years ago,5,"This is so easy to use and makes delicious espresso. I love that you can adjust the amount of foam you want. There are automatic controls and manual controls—your choice. So if you want to top up with just a little more coffee or milk, it's easy. Because of Covid, we miss buying from our favorite coffee shops, which have been closed. This helps! "
Gloria M,3 years ago,5,"We bought this cappuccino/espresso/ latte maker just before the holiday and love it. It makes a great cuppa.  The only thing it doesn’t do is grind your beans. So, you either buy ground espresso beans or grind them yourself.  I am so glad we didn’t waste money on another expensive brand. Its easy to use and perfect for the weekend user. "
Diane,3 years ago,5,"I love this espresso maker. Every morning I make a latte and mix with a little coffee from my coffee maker. Tastes exactly like you are getting it from a coffee shop. Whole milk works best for this machine for frothing IMO. At first we had difficulty getting the porta filter in but once you get that down, it’s super easy and delicious! "
Robs wife,2 years ago,5,Bought it for wifes birthday. She is not technically profecient in any thing and she can work it. She enjoys making the coffees and cappucinos. Enjoys the froth! Good product so far! 
Shahzada,3 years ago,5,"Love Latte and Espresso, and, this machine was offered at a reasonable price at Costco. So far it has worked as advertised. The milk frothier has worked good.  My only reservation is that it is an all plastic product and as such will not last very long. The outer case feels flimsy and could be damaged easily. "
Carole H,3 years ago,4,Very happy with this espresso maker. Easy to use and makes a great tasting espresso. I've taken to making a latte in the afternoons and am very happy with this purchase. My only complaint is about me remembering to remove the container for the milk and storing it in the fridge once I am done making my latte. 
Andy D,3 years ago,5,"Once you figure out the right procedure to make coffee, it makes a real good coffee. And with the options just to froth the milk for other usage, hard to not like this machine. Cleaning is bit tedious, too many parts to clean and store. I don’t think I need to go Starbucks or other store to get good coffee. "
Murali,3 years ago,3,"Good:- easy to use with one touch options- slim profile, doesn't take too much space on the counter Bad:- Latte is never consistent and perfect. Hit and miss.- Not hot enough If you are not too picky, go for it or else, look elsewhere. Costco had a deal for $130. good enough for that price. "
Michael CA,2 years ago,2,"I bought it about 9 months ago but started to use it since 3 months. It worked well, very simple machine, love the compact size, pretty easy to clean. I use it everyday and just for 1 cup. Only 1 morning the pressure suddenly dropped and made it unusable. Returned to Costco & now trying to find other brand "
Sunshine,3 years ago,5,"Love the ease of use with this one-touch expresso and cappuccino machine. It gives me a delightful  Italian experience of having delicious cappuccinos made with with illy decaffeinated coffee and soy milk. And it's easy to clean, especially given the self-cleaning froth button. So I highly recommend it. "
LongIslandAVPro,2 years ago,5,"Discounted during Black Friday,  I received the one touch Mr. Coffee, opened it up. Within 15- 20 minutes, the unit was percolating very well! I had my first double expresso with foam. It was perfect! Thanks Mr. Coffee and Costco! Next week, I can share it with my family and friends during Christmas! "
Ashley S,3 years ago,4,"Chose this as a gift for a coffee lover! He loves making different drinks. It is easy to clean and set up. The frother takes some getting used to, but once you get the hang of it you're good to go. It is compatible with ground coffee and espresso pods. Definitely gives Starbucks a run for their money. "
Michele,2 years ago,5,I experienced this espresso/latte/cappuccino  maker while visiting a friend.  (It was a replacement when her Jura espresso machine stopped working.) She was very happy with the Mr. Coffee machine & I quickly  fell in love with it.  I am over the moon happy with this machine & recommended  it highly. 
Lizzee31,3 years ago,4,"I give this machine a solid 4.   Its easy to use, and clean up is not too bad.  The milk comes out frothy and the coffee is very hot.  After reading many reviews I was always skeptical about purchasing this kind of machine, but am glad I took the plunge.  Its a great pick me up on a cold afternoon. "
Coffee lover,3 years ago,4,"Great except  for coffee holder    hard to position   and if not exact it will ""blow off""  and put grounds in cup    inexact  positioning can also cause leaking of grounds into cup    very easy to not get in exact position  but otherwise  unit is great   the self-cleaning  aspect is a real winner "
PR58,2 years ago,5,"We've had our new Mr. Coffee about 1 mth and so far, we're in heaven - and enjoying starting our day with delicious lattes and cappuccinos every morning! We initially watched some helpful youtube videos showing how to operate and clean everything and that got us off to a great start. "
sazzz,a year ago,5,Great starter espresso maker. Pros: easy to use         automatic espresso          taste is pretty consistent Cons:milk container sometimes does not latch easily and have to try multiple times          some great for big cups as gap for the cup holder is relatively small 
DanL,2 years ago,4,"Pros:   1. 19-Bar makes it perfect for 1/2-shot espresso   2.  Foolproof volume control for 1-2 shotsCons:   1. Milk can needs much more care to avoid spoiled milk   2. Filter holder fails to drain all the coffee, leaving coffee and ground coffee in the holder, easy to splash "
jf31,2 years ago,5,"Wish I would have bought soonerSuper easy to use. This machine has enough pressure to make a coffee drink as good as your local shop. Maintains pressure so that you can make a couple or so in a row. With my old machine, the first drink was cold before you could pull the second. "
Tim Alan,2 years ago,5,Truly the best affordable option. My wife makes espresso for our friends when they stay over and this machine is a hit. She also makes a cappuccino every morning and no longer feels the need to over pay for a Starbucks or DiBruno Bros (we live in Philly) so I’m glad I bought it. 
Carolebarrel,a year ago,5,"Love our new coffee machine.  Works beautifully.  Delicious lattes, cappies, espressos, etc. Took a short while for us to figure everything out but now it's a no-brainer.  Going to order a second machine for our camper.  Also a MUCH BETTER PRICE than anywhere else on the web. "
paullikeslattes,3 years ago,5,"Really enjoy lattes from this machine. I'd been dubious about affordable expresso machines, and after reading reviews I thought it might be difficult to use and to learn how to produce rewarding drinks. It turns out the learning curve was very short -- third try was perfect. "
Mikhail,3 years ago,4,"It works fine - I think it is a very good machine especially for the price that Costco offers, but we did not like the taste of cappuccino as much, returned it and bought a more expensive machine ($400-$500) that is not as automated, but delivers better taste in our opinion "
LLsa,3 years ago,5,The directions are not clear about making the drink but once you learn it is the best machine.  You have to press a button to wake the machine up... then once the blue light stops blinking select your drink. The espresso was perfect and the milk frother omg love love love 
Anonymous,3 months ago,1,Did not like it. When you pressed the small cup button we only got about an ounce of brew. We drink hazelnut coffee which we grind . We could not get the flavor compared with the drip brew machine we have been using. We took the machine back to Costco after about one week. 
SheldonK,3 years ago,5,I have had the Mr Coffee Coffeehouse for over a week replacing my 10 year old espresso machine. This machine is awesome. Make incredible cappuccinos and espresso. So easy. I also love that I can take the milk reservoir with the leftover milk and put it in the refrigerator. 
Ian T,3 years ago,5,"Works quite well if you use the right grind. We initially bought an espresso grind that was ground so fine it was almost like talcum powder, and that didn't work at all, the water couldn't get through. Once we switched over to a normal grind it started working just fine. "
Rolmas,2 years ago,5,"This is the second Mr,Coffee expresso machine that we have own. The first was the Barista which is a very good machine. The new Coffee House is excellent the amount of crema is delightful overall a great machine. I recommend this machine to everyone who enjoys expresso. "
Justin M,2 years ago,2,Bought this machine and was so excited to find a cheaper espresso machine… well not even a week into having it. it already started messing up. The water reservoir leaks and the machine can make a consistent size drink. Unfortunately I will be returning this machine. 
sparka,2 years ago,2,"I live the machine, however..it always leaks water after the cycle. I've tried everything, I bought two of them, and yes..even the second one does it. I keep a paper towel under it foe the leaks and if it doesn't get worse, I'll deal with it, but quite disappointing. "
Ernie,2 years ago,5,"Really enjoy how simple and easy to use!  The drinks turn out awesome! And then there's the price point, which is Great.! I'm not in need of paying $1200 to $2400 for a fancy name brand for when this unit gives me the same or very close to the same drink! "
Katie,3 years ago,5,"Easy to use. Overall great machine for the price! I was looking for an automatic machine that wouldnt break the bank. I love that I can set it up and hit a button and walk away, no need to watch it and make sure I get the correct portion before I stop it. "
Shell,3 years ago,4,"Easy to use and clean. Nice looking on the counter. Personally, I find the latte too milky and cappuccino too dense, but the beauty of the machine is you can customize your drink, so no big deal. If you drink a lot of espresso drinks, you’ll love it. "
Anonymous,4 years ago,5,Terrific product for the price 
Mary,3 years ago,3,I used it for the first time yesterday and decided there are too many steps to make expresso and to froth the milk for cappuccino and parts to clean each time that I would use it.  Also I was disappointed in the taste and the consistency of the foam. 
Paul,2 years ago,1,"Not sure if where Costco is buying after market or maybe they are selling after market items.  But, I had to return the item because it was leaking/spray around the portafilter when making coffee. I was excited to get it and now very disappointed "
Mark B,5 months ago,5,I've been using this little espresso machine every day (sometimes more than once!) and I love it so much. It's incredibly easy to use but has lots of great features. The milk frother works exceptionally well and the whole thing is easy to clean. 
Coffee Lover,3 years ago,5,"This is my first espresso maker so I can’t compare to high-end versions. But for the price, this is a great value. I am loving my morning lattes, and they are done super quick, which is great for busy mornings or breaks while working from home. "
det9,2 years ago,5,"I keep saying, why did I wait sooo long to get a coffee maker like this to enjoy everyday.  The only time I really enjoyed a latte/cappuccino was at a coffee shop paying a lot of money, also a once in a while treat.  This makes the best latte I've ever had, including at coffee shops, now actually look forward to waking to a cup.  I'm pretty sensitive to coffee but for some reason with this machine I'm not as affected and it seems that I don't notice the difference in coffees used that they all still taste delish!  A bit awkward locking coffee dispenser as well as the creamer container but you get used to it.  Also have never had as hot of a cup w/any other maker, finally.  I don't notice the difference between the cap/lat taste at all, just going w/the latte.  The machine itself looks nice, priced right.  Doesn't seem to matter too much which creamer used as they all come out perfect w/the steamer which is the best part not having to manually do anything.  I would absolutely buy this again nor will I ever go back to traditional coffee makers! "
Napes,3 years ago,5,"Works even better than I thought it would. The ""automated"" options are perfect, but if someone wants a little extra of something, they can use the manual buttons to customize their drink. Using it for a couple of weeks and its still working. "
RNP1,3 years ago,5,"This is our first experience with an espresso maker. We are really enjoying the drinks we can make with the Mr. Coffee machine. It took a little while to get the hang of it, but once we did, it is pretty quick to whip up a delicious drink. "
Walt,2 years ago,5,Works and still is working very well. The easiest to operate multipurpose coffee maker I have ever owned. Everything from cappuccino to expresso comes out perfectly. I am using filtered water for best taste and less machine maintenance. 
Vb312,5 months ago,1,"I was so excited to use this, but after several tries, the coffee just sucks. It always comes out tasting like water no matter how much coffee I put into the filter. I even tamp the grounds down as hard as I can. Really sad to return it. "
Todd,3 years ago,4,"The ""plastic"" part on the frother that moves the tube into your coffee cup has broken off 3 times since purchase one month ago.  I would give this expresso machine a 5 star rating if not because of all the plastic part on this machine. "
cme61,2 years ago,5,"I’ve had for few weeks. Love this little machine. I’ve been using it daily to make 2 cappuccinos. I’ve used both loose coffee and the pods. Both work well. The milk frother works awesome, too. Very easy to use and clean. Hope it lasts. "
Soly,3 years ago,4,"Frother is a little loud and doesn't get the foam dense enough and create large bubbles. But over all it's fairly good for the price. I like that fact that you can fit large cups under it, not many espresso machines have that option. "
SteveV,3 years ago,5,"After a bit of research, I decided this was the best option for the price range. The automatic steam milk option is great. We have used this machine daily for about a month now with no issues and no complaints. Great and easy to use! "
Adam,2 years ago,4,"Extremely easy to use, nice size not too big and bulky.  The coffee shots themselves aren’t too hot which means if not steaming milk and you want an americano you have to use a water kettle or it’ll be like warm if you use tap water. "
Jodi,a year ago,2,It worked great I loved it for about 6 weeks then the milk frothier went out and no matter what I do it won’t work. Wish there was a replacement option with sale stuff from Costco that went back this soon but I will be returning it. 
Coffee Nuc,3 years ago,2,"Love the expresso. Good crema and the foam for caapucino was great. Problem is the clmputer works about 1 time in 4. Ask for cappucino and nothing. Try, try, shut-off and try. Eventually it works. Sorry guys - i took it back... "
Jason Bourne,3 years ago,4,"Personally I think the espresso made with this machine tasted better than the Breville one that's twice the cost that my friend has. Easy to use and consistent result, been owning for almost a month and use it daily. "
Marcus,3 years ago,5,"I have had this for a couple of weeks now and I love it! I am now making a double shot Americano every morning instead of a pot of coffee, way faster and effecient, just make sure to buy espresso type coffee grounds "
User,3 years ago,5,Been very happy with performance.  Nice strong espresso.  Easy to adjust the amount of foam. Easy to clean. The milk dispenser detaches and can be stored in fridge if not all used.  Nice machine for the price. 
Coffee lover,3 years ago,5,Saving $ and time since no longer need to stop at Starbucks!  Can store milk container in refrig for next morning; user friendly; easy to clean. Needs espresso grind (like table salt) to work best. Love it 
Whitney,2 years ago,5,What a find! So pleased with this coffeemaker. It is easy to use and offers so many varieties at a bargain price. This easily pays for itself in a month. Would definitely recommend to friends and family! 
Shannon,3 years ago,4,It makes great coffee!!! I didn’t realize it is manual and I have to stand there and manually make each shot. It takes me 10 min to make my coffee. This I do not like. However the coffee tastes awesome! 
spiritwalker,3 years ago,2,Product arrived promptly and in good condition. I was looking for a model that used Kcups. It may have been clear in description but after much research I guess I got confused and ordered the wrong one. 
Kabert,3 years ago,5,I absolutely love this machine.  I had a gift card and what a great way to spend it.  I think my favorite feature is the fact that don't have to froth the milk separately.   The machine does it for me. 
MING,3 years ago,4,It works well. Several small issues. Steam milk a little messy with splashed out mild droplets (previous reviews said the mild dispenser arm can be extended but not true). Warming up a little too long. 
Jubi Mat,2 years ago,4,Love it. I wish i could use the pods on it also the only issue is i have to put a big cup else coffee will flow from sides where i cant capture. Holes where the coffee come out from is too wide apart 
Anthony,3 years ago,5,"Great bang for your buck! Easy to use and it makes a great cup of coffee ☕️, Espresso ☕️, Cappuccino ☕️ and Latte ☕️! Has a self cleaning for the Frothier too! Looks great on my new coffee ☕️ area! "
Hail,3 years ago,5,Great for my needs. First time ever owning an espresso machine. I love this one. The automated options are great in the mornings when I'm trying to do multiple things. Very happy with my purchase. 
Maria,3 years ago,3,"When I received the expresso machine, the box is open not seal, when I see inside, it is new, why the warehouse people don’t seal  the box or put extra box outside, it’s not professional packaging "
Paul,3 years ago,5,Be careful. The top of the milk container is not attached and you must remember to pick up the clear part of the container. Awesome Lattes and Cappuccinos for a fraction of the cost of others. 
firstelectricguitar,3 years ago,5,"Bought this during the xmas sale.  it makes great cappuccinos and espresso.. haven't tried the latte yet.. but it makes my morning coffee choices happier.  easy to use, pretty easy to keep clean "
Hbrunner77,3 years ago,3,It takes some time for the coffee maker to truly warm up even if I leave the power switch on. I was suggested to try this machine but I’ve been finding that my Keurig still is easier to use. 
Nick F,4 months ago,5,Works great!  I use it daily for cappuccino or espresso and I love it.   I like the manual buttons that allow you to top off your cup with extra espresso or milk foam.  Very easy to operate. 
bobbi,2 years ago,5,Took a while to get the hang of it but it makes surprisingly good cappuccinos.  Sometimes I have to wait a bit to do one after another.  Guess it needs some time in between to heat up again. 
Bobbie,3 years ago,2,"I ended up sending it back.There are a lot of steps to use the Mr Coffee and I knew I wouldn""t use it much because of this,I bought an Nespresso instead and LOVE my Nespresso by De Longi. "
Verysadx2,2 years ago,1,It arrived in no outside packaging.  It was a birthday gift.  Tried to set it up and water just leaked out the bottom.  Product was defective.  Returned it to the store. Very disappointing. 
shree,2 years ago,2,"It was working Ok. Like other reviews said it was difficult to clean but suddenly it has stopped frothing the milk. No matter how many times, I perform the clean function, it does not work. "
Mhall,6 months ago,1,"It stopped making espresso less than a year. I followed the manual instructions to clean the machine, repeated a few times, and still didn't produce a shot; tried to make a double shot it came out like a few drops. Since still within one year, contact Mr. Coffee's customer service (this is another level of madness, just be prepared to fight for your warranty and possibly shipping) after hours on the phone, finally agreed to replace the item without a shipping fee. Got the item, didn't open couple of months later, washed it before use let it dry on the counter, and about a few hours later I smelled Burning. the milk reservoir lid was Melting and Smoking. Now, when this happened it was in Oct. of this year (2023) I live in Hollister, CA the weather was about 69F and partially cloudy/sunny, I washed around 8 am when I smelled burn about 11:30 am or before noon. Regardless, none of the parts should be Smoking nor Melting. At this point, I'm still within a one-year time frame, called customer service, and went through the usual of fighting for a warranty, after a long chat, they agreed to a full refund. "
rachel,2 years ago,4,"The espresso is excellent, but the steamer could be better. Overall very happy with it... I don't need foamed milk that much anyway since I usually just add hot water to my espresso. "
Egolf,3 years ago,4,For price it’s a basic does what you need product.  I use it daily and no issues.  I personally use the manual function so I can control the output than the pre programmed  buttons. 
Levis Dude,2 years ago,5,"Inexpensive (comparatively) and works as well as the ""high priced spread"". No problem setup and cleaning afterwards, makes great cappucino or latte or Espresso, highly recommended. "
Joan,2 years ago,5,"This espresso machine one of the best.I m in love with it. The options for latte, cappuccino are so easy to use, just one touch. Highly recommend. I m so happy with this machine. "
lamma,3 years ago,4,This machine has worked great for me in the two months I've had it already. Makes a great espresso! The only test now is longevity. I chose 4 stars because no one reads 5 stars. 
Jane,a year ago,5,This works great.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well it make’s cappuccino with almond milk.  I wanted to drink them but didn’t want a lot of calories.  The froth is great! 
Chirag P,3 years ago,5,Nice and easy to use. Uses a lot of coffee but that's not this machines fault but how an espresso is designed to be. Extreme value for money if you make 2 coffee drinks daily 
Indianer Family,2 years ago,5,"We love this coffee maker! Easy to operate, easy to clean! My daughter is so happy for this purchase, and she makes me the best coffee. I am done with buying coffee outside. "
Mansi,2 years ago,5,It’s so easy to use and no more trips to Starbucks. It makes the best lattes and cappuccinos at home and taste exactly like Starbucks. I am very happy with this purchase. 
John,3 years ago,2,"Worked well but coffee did not taste well. Could be, being new, it had some residue that tainted the flavor but I did not like the taste using my regular espresso grind. "
Mary Mac,3 years ago,5,Works great!  I wish the grounds basket wouldn’t fall out even in the “locked” position but that doesn’t affect the taste. Have purchased two of these -/ one was a gift. 
Anonymous,3 years ago,5,"I enjoy a espresso coffee every morning thanks to this wonderful machine! Not only does it look professional, it is also very convenient, especially with this weather. "
Victim from Costco,2 years ago,1,The coffee scope pub was missing. Someone took the pub inside the box before shipping it to my address. I have to return the espresso machine to Costco for a refund. 
Stephanie D,2 years ago,2,"I wanted to like this, I really did. It was featured on so many lists as highly recommended. The good is that it makes a  consistent drink. Mine was missing the cup for a double shot but the company responded right away and agreed to send me one. I never sent in the required information however as I decided to return this machine. First, it takes forever to heat up. Even when the machine is left on you have to wait a really long time for it to be ready. Second, the attached milk container is horrible. You can't add milk while it is connected to the machine so you have to do that before you use it by removing the unit. Then you have to use more milk than you need because the straw won't suck up the tiny amount at the bottom. The worst part is when you're done you have to immediately remove the milk compartment, dump it the wasted milk, and wash it immediately. One morning I forgot as I was late to work and when I got home I was left with that awful smell (ever find a forgotten sippy cup? It brought back those terrible memories) to deal with. I bought another machine with a separate fritter wand and it is SO much better! "
strickr,a year ago,5,Our third attempt at finding a machine that works well and does both espresso and cappuccino was a success. This machine has worked fantastically and is used daily. 
Rick,3 years ago,5,Both my wife and I really enjoy our coffee drinks each day. It’s easy to use and makes great espresso and latte. I’m glad I purchased it and the price was great.

Salm624,3 years ago,4,"The Good:  This machine exceeded my expectations.  I was hoping for a decent cup of espresso or cappuccino but instead I'm getting great tasting, creamy smooth, delicious coffee drinks.  It heats up and pressurizes very quickly.  I've followed the instructions to the letter since opening the box and it has worked exactly as described. It has a very small footprint which is important if you have limited counterspace (as most do). The Bad: (minor complaints really) 1) There are about three different places in the owners manual describing one or another cleaning process.  It can get confusing which one to use and when to use it.  2) Be prepared to dedicate a fair amount of time cleaning up after making your drinks.  You have run the milk steamer (loud and it lasts for about 30 seconds).  You have to wash several pieces, wipe down the base plate and the catch basin under it and either wash the milk tank and its top piece or put it away in the fridge. This will take you a bit of time to execute.  To me it's worth it. The bottom line: I would buy this again and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to make their own espresso, cappuccino or latte and expects it to taste great but does not feel it would be worth it to invest in a very high priced machine.

Guitarcast,3 years ago,4,"I've used this espresso/cappuccino machine for about a month now. So far I am satisfied with the machine after a rough start. I first unpacked the unit and ran into a snag. I had to run the priming process a few times to get things running. After the first two tries to prime the unit I was ready to pack it up and take it back to Costco. I took one last shot at it after tapping the side where the water tank sits. It appeared to need a 'burping' to free up some kind of air trap the set up during the priming. Third time was the charm in this case. I know I gave this 4 stars and this is because it meets my needs but I did not want to leave out this one issue. That might be a deal breaker for some folks, so heads up on that one. It does work well and I mainly use it to make cappuccinos which are good enough for my tastes. I would not compare it to something I might get at a good cafe. I do like being able to fill the milk container and leave it in the fridge during the week. Just remember to grab it by the clear portion and not the top. This dummy made that mistake once. I have found the unit easy to clean and maintain. On the down side the milk steamer cycle is quite noisy. Not ideal for early morning use. Overall, after one month, I like this espresso/cappuccino maker and hope it will hold up for several years. The jury is still out on that one. "
BriMoo,3 years ago,4,"I was eyeing a fully automatic espresso machine for sometime but just couldn't execute.  In hindsight I wish I had gotten a fully automatic as the prep and cleanup necessary with this model bug me a bit but it's not a huge issue.  In summary this is a great model for the low price range. With an espresso machine I evaluate on two criteria: DURABILITYAn espresso machine is a somewhat fragile piece of machinery.  I wouldn't even consider purchasing a model under $1,000 USD from anyone lacking a great return and support policy  so of course I went with Costco (the greatest company in my opinion) in this regard. As this is a new purchase I can't vouch for it's durability but my expectations are low for a model of this price range.  I'll be happy if I get a year out of it QUALITY:To get coffee house quality espresso a discerning coffee aficionado is going to want to spend at least a grand in my opinion on an espresso machine.  I'm pretty discerning and can taste the difference between this and Starbucks but this is VERY good quality especially for a model of this price range. SUMMARY:It's more of a personal choice but my only regret with not getting a fully automatic machine is that I'm stuck with the setup and cleanup.   Overall a good purchase and when I upgrade I'll probably give this to my daughter for her business or bring it into my office if I ever return. "
GrahamG,3 months ago,5,"This was my first coffee machine so even though it is simple to operate, at my low usage of only 1 or 2 large cups per day it took a week or two to settle into a routine of how to make Cappuccino, Expresso and Americano to my own and guests' tastes, all being either caffeinated or decaffeinated.  It is simple to press the button for small or large expresso or cappuccino but there is a fair amount of preparation before hand and afterwards it can't just be left as is until the next day.  Living in Arizona the climate is warm so I felt I needed to figure out a good cleaning system with small bristle brushes for the crevices in the milk tank and milk steamer to avoid any issues with the milk remnants.  The built in cleaning cycle does not draw up water from say a cup of water placed for the milk pipe.  So the milk tank I just put in the fridge when not in use and give it a thorough clean every so often. The milk pipe is removable so I rinse through every time the tank is put in the fridge.  It would be good to have extra coffee holders so they can be prepared in advance and just swapped out to save having to clear out the grounds and reload coffee every time after say making a large cup.  I had my first coffee morning today with 5 people and I found it a lot of activity to keep everyone supplied while trying to keep up with the conversation.  And I felt it was a bit slow .But I feel practice will help with that and I will look into the availability of these extras. "
BosqueBarista,3 years ago,4,"When my spouse told me about this machine I wasn't expecting much. We have an older inexpensive espresso maker and it isn't very good. Also I'd recently been eyeing machines that were many hundreds more in price. So we were both up to speed on price vs. functionality when this Mr. Coffee machine went on sale at Costco. We took a closer look and thought for the price it was worth just seeing what would happen before making a different, bigger, purchase. In the end, we are totally surprised and impressed! After the initial priming of the system (quite loud on the first load of water in the machine, much better after), the 19 bar pressure combined with the single and double shot filters produce a decent crema for any drink. It heats fast using a thermocouple system instead of boilers (two different ready lights in front let you know when the Milk frother or Espresso water is ready). The Automatic milk frother is adjustable for more or less foam, is easily cleaned, and can be stored in the fridge. The porta-filter is only around 45mm in size, but is hefty in weight and sits flat on the counter for loading. It can use Easy Serving Espresso pods of that size in the single filter to save on cleanup, but we haven't tried that option. We only need to gently hold the top of the machine when installing the porta-filter after tapping down the espresso to 3mm or 1/8th inch from the top. We have a separate $90 burr grinder that produces a good espresso grind, and we'd recommend getting a decent burr grinder to compliment this unit for optimal results. But with the right grind dialed in, this little guy pretty much operates like a super-automatic many times its price. Build quality is decent but there are no user serviceable parts, and a lot of plastic, so fingers crossed on long term use, because we are using it all the time! Depending on settings and grind the pucks can be damp after a pull, requiring a bit of finesse when emptying the portafilter. But for pressurised filters on systems without boilers this is not unusual. The drip tray has a clever red dot that will raise when full, but we can do 4 or 5 lattes, including post steam clean on the milk frother and still not have it full (close, but not full). It really is push button easy if you want. However, we have found a combo of the manual and auto controls to do the trick every time. We use the manual controls to pre-heat the portafilter and the cup(s) first, then load the porta-filter and use the auto controls for the size and type of drink. The neat thing on the manual controls is you can expand the drink options. For example you could use the manual controls to get hot water, and espresso and a little steamed milk to make an americano to your tastes. Over all, we feel if you take the time to dial in your inner barista, this is a very capable machine for the money. Only complaint is the single and double filters that fit nice and snug during the first couple of uses now spin freely in the porta-filter. They don't fall out, unless the alignment notch is lined up when you knock a puck out upside down. Not a huge thing as it's easy to keep the notch aligned, but just fyi, It's the only thing that makes us hold one star back given all the functionality and performance for the price. Sure it's not a $1,500 machine, but it definitely gives the $500-$800 machines a run for the money. Costco had the best price when we purchased on sale and for a $100-200 machine that has an auto milk frother we feel it's a steal. Just make sure to use good water and do your normal barista cleanup to keep it running smooth. (BTW the manual lists a couple of extended clean cycles you can run every now and again.) "
Adolfox,3 years ago,5,"This review is for Cuisinart 4-slice toaster.  This toaster replaced my 5 years old Cuisinart 4 slice taster which was also bought from Costco.  I had to replace it because it failed.  This toaster has additional toasting settings for waffle, pastry and English muffins.  The setting all works as expected but takes a bit getting used to dial setting for darker and lighter toasts.  This toaster has 3 years warranty which Costco Visa extend it to 6 years. With additional online $10 Costco coupon was a great buy again. The old toaster also had 3 years warranty too and because it failed withing extended warranty Costco Visa replaced it. I'll buy again! "
McBob,3 years ago,5,"I have used Cuisinart products for years and find them to be quality units. This toaster replaces an existing 2-slice Cuisinart for one reason: my wife is gluten intolerant and gluten free bread is hard to toast well. Plus, we tired of ""waiting on the toaster"" to each toast our bread. This toaster met our expectations. It toasts her gluten-free bread evenly, on either single or double slice settings, while mine goes happily along on the other side of the toaster with its own settings. So far, only Bread and English Muffin options have been used, but I don't expect a problem with the others, which we seldom use. "
mtw66,2 years ago,2,"Bough this to replace an older Cuisinart that we purchased at Costco several years ago.This one requires way too much force on the lever to start toasting.You really have to smash it down to turn it on and there is no indication other than it getting hot or not.Being that the lever is the weak link that broke in the old model and this one doesn't look like it has being redesigned, I don't think this one will last long.It does not have a chime when it pops up.It does not pop up very hard, kind of gets stuck.The 1-sided bagel feature tells you to put the cut side out, opposite of what is most intuitive and the way the old one worked. "
Sunshine,2 years ago,1,"I received the Cuisinart toaster about a week ago and have been disappointed with it's performance.  The right side of the toaster controls do not work properly. The digital light continues to run up & down. The defrost light will not go off. The lever to push the bread down with is difficult to do so. The bread does not toast - it pops right back up.  The left side of the toaster operation is better but not as expected.  I have never had a problem with Cuisinart products - in fact our last toaster, same brand, lasted 20 years.  Taking this defective product back to Costco today. I am sorry that it did not work out. "
Gary,3 years ago,1,"Have been a Cuisinart customer for years, and thought this would be a super toaster. Most of the numerous “features” are really just marketing hype. 1. The one-slice feature does nothing. Both sides get red hot. 2. Selections for BREAD, WAFFLES, BEAGLE, ENGLISH MUFFIN, and PASTRY all seem to do the same job. In none of these settings is the outside heating element on while the inside element is off. Both are on. To summarize, it will make toast but none of the fancy features is real. Someone in marketing made a decision to sell this to suckers, and I fell for it. I think that person or persons should be fired. I won’t be buying any more Cuisinart products because of this scam. "
CJ L,3 years ago,1,"Very disappointed to see that Cuisinart would put their name on this toaster!  I give it a one star rating.  Looks beautiful on counter and that's all it does. You still have to dig for your toast/bagel or pastry item as they never pop up far enough to get them out easily.  That is a feature that Cuisinart prided themselves on.  Does not really toast at all.  I have to put everything pretty much on a 6 or a 7.  Several times one side was black and other side was still soft.  Who knows, maybe my toaster was defective, ( I will give Cuisinart the benefit of my doubt).  I own many Cuisinart products so really, this toaster is not up to par for the brand name.  I have recently returned this item. "
MisterD,2 years ago,2,"I returned the first two of these because the toaster wasn’t wired properly. Selecting the single slot option did the same thing as the bagel option and did not just turn on only 1 slot. Now that I’m on my 3rd one the wiring is correct, but I really struggle with this because it does not toast evenly. 1 side of the bread burns while the other is not done enough. This is true of all slots and on all settings I’ve tried. I think it just runs too hot and overcooks. It’s disappointing because this is a good looking toaster and the price is fantastic. I’m going to return this and go for another brand. "
CA Bagel Lover,3 years ago,2,"We bought this to replace our older Cuisinart toaster.  As we took the new one out of the box, we could tell how cheap and flimsy it felt!  And, now that we've used it, we found that it really is a poor-quality toaster.  The slots are not as wide enough to accommodate a bagel, and we often have to scrape it out.  Even using the highest setting, we have to toast bagels and toast twice, to get the desired shade.  You have to push down on the levers at least 2 times to begin the toasting.  Overall, a very disappointing product.  Will be returning ASAP. "
Barbara Rose,3 years ago,1,My 2 slice Cuisinart toaster I've had for years started taking longer to toast and had to be set on a higher setting. I decided to replace it with this 4 slice one. The 4 slice didn't perform as well as my old toaster. I had to put it on the highest setting and then turn the toast or waffles and toast for a few more minutes. I returned it and am using the old toaster for now. I was very disappointed because I loved the 2 slice Cuisinart when it was new. 
Johnny H,3 years ago,1,Tried the single slice feature on the toaster and observed elements in both slots heating. Posted questions on-line and called customer support and received contradictory statements regarding the single slice behavior. Returned first toaster and second toaster does same thing. I measured power draw with single slice enabled and disabled and there is no difference: 900W for bread setting regardless of single slice setting. Tested toasting a single slice with and without single slice enabled and saw no difference. Called Cuisinart support again and rep told me that both slots heat up regardless of single slice setting. So this feature isn’t really a feature at all. It’s just a marketing lie. If you’re buying this for the single slice feature don’t bother - it literally does nothing but turn the button LED on or off. 
SJCA,3 years ago,1,"The toaster looks nice, but that's about the only pro. The cons:1) You have to press real hard in order for the toaster to start working. 2) Once toasting is done, the lever hardly rises and the sound it makes is very faint. So it's basically impossible to know when the toast is ready. 3) Even when you lift the lever up, it's very difficult to take out the toast.  Will return and get a less fancy, but functional, toaster. "
Johnny Rondo,3 years ago,1,"I have had this toaster for two months now and I am not happy with this unit.The bread does not get toasted evenly; one edge is almost burnt and the other edge has not begun to get toasty yet. Also, the single slice option does not work. When I set it for single slice both it still has the double burners running. "
TutuQutu,3 years ago,5,". This is a very nice toaster. It looks beautiful, and operates flawless for years. This is our second piece, as our first one is taken by our son to his college dorm. "
Karl,3 months ago,2,"I bought this about a year ago and it has had considerable use. I've been a satisfied Cuisinart brand customer for decades with close to a dozen of their appliances in my kitchen. This toaster, bought because of its many features is very disappointing. It fails at making basic toast. The heat elements are programmed or engineered incorrectly so it never makes a consistent even piece of toast. One side is vastly different from the other and the center is untoasted while the ends are nearly burnt. I've tried all the different selections, dials, etc. and cannot get a basic decent piece of toast. All of my other Cuisinart products are great but this one is a dud. "
ahill,3 years ago,1,Threw away my $9.99 toaster to get this which can’t toast One side burns on 3 setting and other side burns on 6 settingIt’s a toaster! How can you not get it to work properly 
Mary in Maryland,3 years ago,3,"I like the many types of items available to select from to toast but this toaster seems to not be very sturdy.  As well, the bread or other items when finished toasting don't come up very high so you need wooden tongs to get items out.  And the toasting doesn't seem to be very even or dark enough, and that is with the selection knob on the darkest option. Doesn't seem worth the price. "
Anonymous,2 years ago,1,We may have bought the bad apple in the bunch but this toaster would not regulate the degree of burn in the bread and over toasted everything even on the lowest setting.  Also one side stopped locking down and would not latch when bread was inserted.  Costo took it back without a fuss.  Not my typical experiende with Cuisinart. 
Cando,3 years ago,1,Did not toast evenly on both sides of bread.  Too many confusing lights.  Hard to adjust the color/darkness of toast. 
SA shopper,3 years ago,1,"Just received and tried it out immediately. Dark on one side, nothing on the other. Plus the toasted side is unevenly browned, including burnt places. Wish I could post photos. "
Buffy,3 years ago,5,"We love this toaster! It's really fast. On our old toaster the setting equaled minutes to toast, which was terrible. This toaster evenly browns, if you pay attention to what setting you used, e.g. English muffin, bagel, single slice, etc. "
michiganman68,2 years ago,1,"Most convoluted toaster on the market. Half the time I pull the levers down, it does not turn on the toaster. Bagel feature only heats one side of the bagel. I cut my finger when putting in some toast due to a burred edge on the inside of the toaster well. Toaster makes obnoxious noise when done toasting. Overall i would give this 0 stars but thats not an option, will be promptly returning this. "
BeckyAnne,2 months ago,5,"Bought this a couple months ago and expected better from the Cuisinart brand. We own other Cuisinart small kitchen appliances and have never experienced this lack of quality; will be cautious with the brand in the future. The level of toasting is inconsistent when the selected level has not been changed (burnt on level 3!) and it differs from the right side to the left. Pushing the lever down seems more difficult than other toasters we've had, and the toast does not pop up high enough to access without lifting up on the lever. Toaster slots seem to be narrower than previously owned toasters as well. Burned one slice too many so returning it. "
Joanna,a year ago,5,"This toaster looks nice on the counter (it's less bulky looking than some others) and does all that it promises.  After a small amount of trial and error, I've figured out which settings I prefer for different types of bread.  The defrost feature allows you to take bread slices from the freezer and produce the exact doneness you desire.  The two levers allow you to give an extra lift to your toast to avoid scorching your fingers while removing your items.  The outside surface has a lovely finish and is very easy to clean, as are the two pull-out drawers in the back.  Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase and feel that this toaster is an excellent value to replace my previous Cuisinart model. "
Jeanie,3 years ago,3,"The toaster is beautiful and compliments our kitchen. However, I have noticed a lag in the start control button which causes me concern. Thinking my toaster is working, I find it has not connected to the ""toast"" element causing me a delay in my timing. I don't want to request a replacement but I may need to do so. This is our third Cuisinart and I have never encountered this problem before. "
Emma,3 years ago,1,"Right out of the box, the spring loading mechanism never worked properly. Hard to get to stay down when pushed. Toast doesnt pop up - you have to hold the lever up to retrieve. I dont think this toaster is going to last very  long. Old, inexpensive toaster, which still works, was ten years old! "
JJ12345,7 months ago,4,"This toaster works pretty well, but I don't like that I have to select ""bread"" before I push the handle down to toast.  If I don't select ""bread"", I have to push it twice; the first time it will pop back up and I need to hit it a second.  Not a deal breaker, but there shouldn't be two steps to use a toaster.  I don't think the ""single"" slice feature does anything as I've tried it and nothing is different than when I don't hit that feature and toast just a single slice.  I like the adjustment for how cooked I like my toast and that works well.  I don't use bagels or waffles so I can't tell you how it works for those features.  I would recommend this toaster still because it toasts our bread just fine. "
Taschka,5 months ago,1,"Many things to say about this toaster, none of them good. We wanted a double toaster for ages and were so excited to find one at Costco. This one is silly and I regret not taking it back. You must “wake” the toaster before using. So, you can’t just put your toast in and push the lever. The lever or one of the buttons must be pressed and THEN you can toast your bread. My parents have an older model of this and do not have this issue. And after using this for a year, it only toasts bread on one side. Also wish there was a “warm/reheat” function. We’ll deal with this one until we can afford another one but as soon as we can, this one is out. "
Gary,10 months ago,1,"I’ve had this toaster for a couple weeks. While it looks nice on the counter, it does not perform well. As others have mentioned, the latch requires a lot of force to engage. Sometimes it latches but fails to start toasting. When the toast is done, the carriage fails to raise the toast all the way, so you need to manually raise it to remove the toast. On the same setting, the level of toasting is inconsistent from day to day. Also as others have mentioned, the single slice function only turns off the heating elements on one side of the second slot, which seems like a design fail. "
Mark,3 years ago,5,"So far so good. It’s all stainless steel, not sure why it’s shown also in white. "
Taylor B,3 years ago,1,This is a horrible toaster.  I have bought Cuisinart for years.  Does not toast evenly and when you put the lever down to toast you have to make sure it clicks all the way down to start the electric elements.  They have cheapened this toaster up.Returning tomorrow at the store 
Greg,3 years ago,1,One side does light up the other under cooks 
Shopper,2 years ago,3,"Mixed feelings. Works very fast. However difficult to know which darkness settings to use and inconsistent results. Sometimes a 3 setting will be fine, sometimes the toast isn't toasted at all and has to be repeated with the usual burned results. On bagels and English muffins you have to be careful to put the bread sides to be facing out which is counterintuitive. You also have to make sure the toaster handles are properly engaged or the toaster will unexpectedly turnoff. Too much of a learning process and disappointing. I'd return but my wife insisted on throwing out the old and slow Kenmore toaster. "
Sparkie,3 years ago,5,"Toasts everything evenly, from English muffins to raisin bread. The controls make it easy to fine-tune settings. Brushed stainless exterior wipes clean and there's no annoying groove around the top of the toaster to collect crumbs. We miss having a beep to alert when the toast is done, but we can live without it :0) "
D A Davis,3 years ago,3,Product’s fine but manufacturer refuses to register it because they don’t accept Costco’s model number. 
Jester1028,3 years ago,4,"Just got this toaster yesterday, used it this morning. It has a single slice/slot option. Pressed ""single"" button but both slots lit up. "
SueP,3 years ago,5,"This is a really nice toaster.  It's smaller than our other toaster and has more features depending on what you plan to toast...bagels, bread, pastry, etc. I looks good on the countertop and having the two sides, we don't have to keep changing the settings.  Also like the one slice feature. "
Traycee,3 months ago,1,"This is probably the worst toaster I’ve ever had. Somehow one side of the toast gets more done than the other. One side can be burnt and the other side just right. One side can be just right and the other one still cold. I’m not talking about the different openings; I’m talking about the item that was put in. You have to push the lever down twice. The first time you push it down everything lights up, so you think it is working, but no. You need to push it down a second time to start it. I finally got used to it. I would push down once walk away and come back to it not even started. "
Bant,2 years ago,1,The coils only work on one side so you have to keep turning your slices. This is the 4th Cuisinart toaster I have purchased in 4 years all with the same problem. Will be returning this item. Crazy that Cuisinart would ruin their brand with such an inferior product: how hard can it be to build a proper toaster! I give it one star because it looks nice. 
Skibness,2 years ago,1,This name brand toaster couldn’t do the one thing it was bought for. Toast bread. A setting of 4 made darker toast than a setting of 7. Browning differed between the 4 slots. Browning varied across a single slice or on each side. All 4 slots had weak pop up mechanisms. And this is a CUISINART! Very disappointing. 
Tant,3 years ago,1,Returned.  Half the heating elements didn't even get hot/turn red even at the highest setting.  Did not toast bread at all.  What a waste.  Anyone know of any toaster that works? 
alberto22,3 years ago,2,"The looks are great, but there are serious defects in the product. First the popping up does not work. After the bread has been done, the toaster does not pop them up. Neither of the two levers come up. Second, the single toast function doesn't turn off the heat in one of the compartments. The toasting however is good. If you are willing to stand next to the toaster and wait until it has turned off heat to guess when to pop your toasts manually, you will be fine. But that is what you bought this toaster for. You need automation in life. Unfortunately Cusinart has not done a good job on this model. I have had Cusinart for more than 15 years. I changed to this one because I got bored with the old one, using the same toaster everyday. for so many years. It didn't fail on a single toast in all these years. A wife a two kids later, it is still popping. Looks like my Ol Cusinart is coming back. I will be returning this new one to the store. "
Mari,2 years ago,1,"In less than 2 months of use, one of the levers won't come up. It's used pretty lightly, so seems this toaster is not really made to last "
Jeremiah,a year ago,1,"The single button doesn't work. I thought it was the specific toaster, brought back the unit and the same thing happened with the second one! I called Cuisinart for technical support and they pretty much said ""oh well""... I mean, it doesn't seem to much to ask, in having it function as advertised. It was a very disappointing experience. This was the only toaster available within the warehouse, I will try other stores for different options. "
59Acoupe,3 years ago,2,Difficult to get the bread to be evenly toasted.  Odd that it toasts on one side on the bread setting. Not a fan of stainless and with the toaster being stainless it always seemed spotty and dirty looking. Just  not the right for us. 
Bruce,2 years ago,5,"Although it’s still relatively new, early indications are that this will be the best toaster we’ve ever owned. Have used to toast bagels, bread and waffles so far and the programmed settings work very well. Overall, quality appliance that looks as good as it toasts! "
Old Sole,8 months ago,5,"We purchased this as our old two-slice toaster quit working well, so much so that we needed to run each piece through two cycles.  We toast four to six slices of bread each day so it took a lot of time to prepare toast.  We’ve only had the new Cuisinart toaster about two weeks but thus far, we are very pleased.  It toasts all four pieces on both sides within one cycle.  The button for one slice works well too, and it’s nice-looking.  The only minor drawback is that it is large and might take up too much room for those with limited counter space. "
Mk579,8 months ago,4,"(1) I can confirm this is a toaster. It toasts.(2) I’ve used the Bagel feature not just for bagels but for burger buns (very useful), and the single slice feature And they all work well.(3) This model is useful for families vs. the smaller model. More toast-capacity. I think we can all agree that a toaster’s main function is to toast - no matter the look of it, or the wizz-bangery a company tries to add to the toaster. It toasts! Buy it, and go toast, my friends. "
Mary Swank,3 years ago,1,"It doesn’t seem like all of the coils heat up simultaneously, we have struggled with getting our toast evenly browned. Sometimes it burns it and other time it is spotty looking "
Old one,2 years ago,5,It works great on bagels and muffins as well as toast. it browns toast well on both sides and muffins and bagels on one side. You can control the darknets on them very well. It just works great. 
Cat and Paul,3 years ago,2,This toaster will not take bagel split in half. Nor will it take many loaf breads that I buy. The place where you put the bread is to skinny. I am not pleased with this product. 
Guesswho,2 years ago,2,"6 months into buying my toaster, half of the toaster doesnt work. Also the feature to toast one slice stopped working. Will contact costco incase there is a recall of some sort. "
Peter L,a year ago,5,"This Cuisinart Toaster replaced one that lasted for over 12 years. This new version of the Cuisinart 4-Slice Toaster comes with a few more and very useful options, so it will handle all our toasting needs for bread, bagels, english muffins, and more. It has a one slice feature that allows you to only turn on one of the slots so it's a lot more efficient. We've used it on bread (one slice and multiple slices and bagels so far and it works great!!! "
GhsKid,3 years ago,3,"We are huge Cuisinart fans, but this appears so much cheaper made then our last Cuisinart of over ten years use.  Our expectations are low from how cheap it seems to be made but time will tell.  It does work great so no surprise there as the name of quality.  Works great however so let us hope it lives up to its name.. "
tedk,2 years ago,5,"Looks great and toast is done perfectly, evenly and in minimal time.  We like it so much we bought a 2nd one "
Pamela,3 years ago,3,"It had a ding in it, right in the front!So I returned it. "
Rugby,2 years ago,1,Replacing original purchase because the toaster did not pop up and burned toast to a crisp 2 times.  When burned toast discovered cancel button did not stop.  Had to unplug.  First time was grandson and I attribited the failed pop up to something he did wrong.  Second time was me and I knew it was a bad toaster so we are exchanging.  Both occurences were within first month of arrival. Will update review after new one arrives. 
LeslieC,a year ago,5,"Our old cuisinart was a wedding gift… 16 years ago. It was starting to produce soggy waffles which were unacceptable to the under 10 crowd. I over thought and over analyzed and finally went with something from Costco because if I hated it, it goes back. But it’s great! Waffles toast perfectly (according to the eggo snobs) and I can even cram a sliced Costco croissant into it. Delicious. Good thing Costco sells pants, too. "
Steve,a year ago,5,Had an old ugly toaster my wife hated but it was consistent and toasted well whereas reviews online for other toasters made me think changing it out would be a bad idea. Figured with the return policy if it didn't work well I could return it but we're a few years in and the only issue I've had is if someone doesn't pay attention to the settings you can end up with burnt or poorly toasted items (having defrost selected vs not for instance).  So long as you hit the right button for what you're toasting it works great! 
Nonrof1,a year ago,1,"Bought this toaster on November 18th, 2022. It has never fully toasted a piece of bread. The lights flicker, shine bright then dim, won't allow selection of bread type, pops up after just seconds of toasting, etc. Returning it! Instructions say to unplug the toaster when not in use. Anybody that knows anything about electricity knows that's unsafe when dealing with a purely resistive circuit. I tested the cord after unplugging it and it's carrying static electricity. In other words, this is a MAJOR fire hazard! "
Marti,3 years ago,4,We usually have to push handle down twice for it to stay down 
John K,3 years ago,1,"Don't like it.  The descriptions of the various choices are small and hard to read when placed on the counter.  The slots are not good (wide) for larger slices, or large bagels.   Sorry I bought it! "
asgeorge,3 years ago,5,"We are very pleased with the quality of our new toaster. It toasts very evenly, and all the controls work flawlessly. The levers lift the toast out of the toaster very nicely. Couldn’t be happier. "
Katie,2 years ago,4,"I needed to purchase a 4 slice toaster and this one was a great price. I’ve only used it about 5 times. So far , I’m not sure how to change from “toast” to “English muffin “ unless you unplug the toaster or wait 90 seconds. But that’s not too difficult, just annoying. Single slice works fine, toast darkness settings toast the way we like. Hopefully it will last a few years. We’ll see! "
Hannah,3 years ago,1,"I ordered it online because there was no item in Costco store.I regretted it. UPS threw things in the yard, the box was open, and the product seems not be new. I'll return this item. "
Gfrankel2,a month ago,1,"Replacing broken toaster with newer model by same company.  The old toaster had several features missing on the new one and it worked better.   - Lever needs to be pressed down twice to get the toasting to begin - Toasting is very uneven - old toaster beeped when done, not on this one - old toaster showed progress as it toasts, no display on new one Going to return to Costco "
TexasChar,a year ago,3,"Does not evenly toast, no matter what slot is used. Some edges may be nearly burnt, while the rest of the toast is slightly brown. Quality of appliances are a thing of the past. "
Mishonio,2 years ago,1,"After a few weeks of usage, the unit stopped working  Cuisinart support are not responding. What a company! Won’t be buying their products  Won’t be buying from them "
ClevelandGal,2 years ago,4,"It’s great to be able to do four slices at once. But we’re having trouble sometimes. You have to push the lever down hard or push it twice to get the heating element to start. I use the bread setting every day and it’s working fine but my son has trouble with the bagel setting. The bread is toasted dark on setting 3. Watch the stainless steel finish: the first one I got was dented so I returned it. Also it smells like burning plastic the first few times you use it, so open a window for ventilation. "
BowPuppy,2 years ago,5,"Quiet! This is not a violent popping toaster, and I enjoy the multiple settings. It does not burn the bagel, which is important! "
Tim54,2 years ago,5,"Great toaster . Perfect toast ,  Bagels and English muffins . A big step up from our 20 year old Black & Decker . "
Sylvia,3 years ago,2,This product Is terrible. It doesn’t toast the bread on all sides. Poor quality! I am going to return it. 
Emily,8 months ago,1,"I don't know how a toaster can be this obnoxious, but it is!  The ""toasting"" lever sounds old and rusty.  Sometimes it catches, sometimes it doesn't.  Sometimes the ""4"" setting barely toasts the bagels, other times it burns it.  My last toaster from Cuisinart was great until it broke; this is their new version and it doesn't compare to the old one. "
Nikki,2 years ago,5,Love this toaster! Just what I was looking for at an affordable price. 
Jason L,2 years ago,4,"Works great. Looks very sleek and modern. I like how each side has it's own functions so i can toast one more or less. Only issue is I wish the toast would completely pop up when done. It kind of pops slightly and stop cooking, and I have to push the toast slider up manually to get it out enough to pull out. It's not a big deal though. "
Mike,2 years ago,5,"Works as advertised.  Great for bagels, waffles or toast. "
Debby,2 years ago,1,"This product was a little disappointing. While the appearance is very nice, and the features are really swell, the toaster levers felt flimsy and cheap. The action on the levers that lift up popped toast seemed uneven for each side. I wish I had had the opportunity to actually examine it in person before purchasing. I most likely would not have wasted time and effort on the part of Costco! "
Carlsbad,3 years ago,1,Very slow to toast.  Doesn’t pop up. 
Laura,3 years ago,1,Returned 
Elizabeth,2 years ago,5,I purchased this toaster because I needed yes but because I could see the quality in it. It’s the best toaster I’ve ever had. Other toasters I have made claims to be this or that. But never lived up to what they claimed to be. This toaster makes my toast and other morning meals perfectly. I highly recommend it. I’m sure you will wonder how you ever got along without it. Plus it’s made by one of the best brands on the market. So win win there!!! Thanks again Costco!!! 
Tanner,3 years ago,4,"We have owned a similar toaster by Cuisinart for the last 10 years with no complaints. We thought it was time to upgrade and get a new one so we purchased this stainless steel model. Arrived on time and packaging looked good, but when opened up the stainless steel on the top of the toaster had some decent scuffs in plain view. We plugged it in... put some bread in and it toasted them... tried bagels and it toasted them too. Not much else to complain about. "
Kiki,3 years ago,5,"The second toaster  is great. I returned the first one last week. The first toaster did not work (single toast slot side lever did not go down). Hopefully, this one will continue to work.  I had my last Cuisinart 4 slice toaster for 8 years, so here’s hoping. "
Anonymous,2 years ago,1,"This toaster is poorly constructed, the toast levers frequently jam or not engage at all. This toaster even on the darkest setting frequently requires re-toasting. "
Joey,2 years ago,1,Like all the reviews here less than one star. Everything everyone says on the negative is absolutely true. Ours stopped toasting one side of bread and burned other side. Returning to store when I get another brand in place. Stay away. Looks will fool you. 
Jane,2 years ago,5,Cooks quickly and evenly and can toast many different types of bread. Temperature and time are easy to control. We also like the lever which raises the toast after toasting so you can get it out with burning your fingers or looking for the tongs. 
Tkreusch,2 years ago,5,"I love this toaster. It’s doesn’t beep, which I love but my husband hates. Toasts amazing, but very sensitive in level of toasting with the knobs so be careful. Defrost option works wonderful. All and all my favorite toaster yet, great price. "
Keszler300,8 months ago,1,This toaster's settings are not consistent at all. Either everything is burnt or not toasted at all. It doesn't matter what setting it's on. Never thought a toaster would make me this irritated. 
Rosaura,3 years ago,1,The box arrived all beaten and the product in very bad condition. 
Bob Mi,2 months ago,1,"Owned a Cuisinart 4 slice toaster for 10 years and it was great.  Ordered a new on several weeks ago on line at Costco.  One row of elements were barley lit.  It was not on Bagle setting.  Returned to Cosco Whs. without a hitch.  Ordered another one on line at Costco. The second Cuisinart Custom Select 4-Slice Toaster.  The new toaster had exactly the same problem with the row of elements.  Called Cuisinart customer service to see if they were getting the same response from other customers.  They said no, and indicated I should return it to Costco Whs. They could care less if I purchased anymore of their products.  Too bad since I have other quality Cuisinart products.....End of that Brand in our house.  Thank you Costco as we will continue to be your loyal customer because of your other great products, customer service and employees to care about the customer. "
CAL98,2 years ago,5,Brushed exterior helps with fingerprints. Versatile for family or single person: can toast 4 bagels/English muffins or a single slice of bread. Keeps 2 settings in memory. 
TEENS,8 months ago,1,Only half of the heating element wires heat up on any of the 4 slices. I have never had such a bed toaster. Should have returned it but was inconvenient time. 
KathySF,2 years ago,5,"Great toaster! Bought one for my dad months ago. Then when my toaster failed, I bought the same toaster for myself. I’m certain it’s the best. "
Allison J,2 years ago,5,Love the toaster. Stainless steel is sleek. Style slightly old fashioned. Love the blue lights against the silver. Toasts the bread evenly. 
JAS55,2 years ago,5,Excellent toaster. The best we have ever had. Toasts uniformly. Various settings are very useful. Style is appealing. Highly recommend. 
Juliek5,2 years ago,5,"It does exactly what I wanted it to. My old toaster had just died after 20 years, so I ordered this one and it is awesome! Love it... "
Poorbikrchick,5 months ago,4,"Very fast and even toasting. Seems like the slots should a bit longer. For the price, I like it. Glad I didn’t spend more than I did. "
KG69,2 years ago,5,"Looks great and toasts evenly. Many choices for a bagel, waffle, toast muffin and more. So nice to be able to toast 4 items at once. "
Happy customers,2 years ago,5,"We love this toaster! It does a great job toasting a variety of items, it's really quick, and looks great!Definitely recommend! "
Ed W,a year ago,5,Toasts all types of breads very well and uniformly. The sides of the unit do not get hot like some more cheaply made toasters. 
erta,3 years ago,4,"Toaster looks nice.  It actually toasts, but it's slow to do so.  Negative would be too many options. "
Boe 1,3 months ago,1,Uneven toasting.  Burns edges of bread.  Both sides of bread toast differently. 
Joyce,3 years ago,5,Got one in my Florida home & liked so much go another for my Pa home. 
Shorts,3 years ago,3,It is not consistent toasting the bread. 
1CARLOS,2 years ago,5,Great for a large family 
Bob G,3 months ago,2,"The appearance of the toaster is nice, but its functionality is terrible. It has selections for bread, bagel, waffle, pastry and English muffin. The problem is all the buttons perform the same, and that is bagel. If you look in when it is toasting you can see only the outer elements are heating up (Glowing)  on the outside position of the toaster, the inside position all the elements are heating up. When the bread comes out, on one side only the outer edge is toasted and the other side is completely toasted. It’s the same on either left or right, and nothing changes if you hit bagel or any other button selection. Instead of having simple toaster they over complicated it and failed in its basic function to toast bread. Ive taken pictures that show what is going on but can’t post them on this site. So bottom line, if you want a toaster specifically for bagels, this is your machine, otherwise find another! "
SAMO,3 years ago,3,Good but not perfect! 
waltsh,a month ago,2,"This toaster is adequate, but a couple of things I don’t care for are;  too many choices in small print on the buttons and how the base doesn’t stay put on the counter.  Every time I push down to lower the bread into the toaster-it dances away.  Very disconcerting and a little dangerous because the appliance is hot.  Also when I hit “Cancel”,  the Toaster stays on. "
Kandi,2 years ago,5,"I haven't had a toaster for a while but I have been eating more bread and would like to be able to toast it. I really like this toaster. It has a way to do a single side and has different buttons for bread, bagel, waffle, pastry and English muffin. It also has a defrost button. The lever that you press down also goes up to remove the toast without any difficulty. The only thing that I would like that it doesn't have is a removable bottom or drawer to easily clean. THAT would make it perfect. Thanks Cuisinart! You've done it again! "
Ischlep,2 years ago,3,"While it toasts significantly faster than my toaster oven, it feels very flimsy.  When the toasting is done, the bread barely comes up to the top, there is no ""ding"" or bell to let me know it's over.  And I've noticed that it toasts more on one side of the bread than the other.  I mean, it works but it's very so-so for a Cuisinart product.  I expected better. "
scootgal,a year ago,2,"I am disappointed with this Cuisinart toaster. I like others have an issue ensuring the button is pushed down all the way. I will have the rest of breakfast ready to go and realize the toaster is not toasting since the button was not engaged all the way. I also have problems with getting it to toast the right way. It always seems to be too dark no matter how light I set the toaster. This is a disappointing toaster from Cuisinart. I have given this a 6 month trial and will be returning. Thank you Costco, for your return policy. "
K92217,2 years ago,1,The toaster I received was scratched and the card wasn't wrapped. It was returned after it was opened. 
Lg is not smart,a year ago,1,"This toaster does not hold the bread down to be toasted.  I frequently have to push it down several times & hold it down until the coils turn on.    Once it “ engages” it seems to work fine, but it is disappointing on timing with other foods when the bread is not toasted when the rest of the meal is ready.    I do not recommend this toaster "
John M,a month ago,1,"Our third or fourth one in 10 years, and they haven't improved it one bit over that time, but it's the only 4 slice toaster at Costco, so we bought it. Controls are flimsy (the handle on the last one broke) and does not toast dark enough.  We returned onlyone previously and may return this one...and then buy a better brand somewhere else. "
Lauren B,3 years ago,3,"The sides get really, really hot. "
Michael from ATX,2 years ago,4,This was our second one as we loved our first one and we bought this as a gift.  The only reason we are not giving 5 stars is the right side toaster does not always start though you have pushed the slider down.  This is minor so 4.5 would be a more accurate rating.  We do like it enough to purchase one as a gift! 
disappointed cb,a year ago,1,"I was disappointed with this Cuisinart Toast.  It had everything I wanted in a toaster, but...unfortunately, it only toasted the bottom half of the bread or bagel, and with the toast settings of 1-10, anything over 2 1/2 was burnt.  Hoping this toast is just defective and all of them are not like this one. "
Anonymous,2 days ago,5,I purchased this toaster to replace a 4 sliceCuisinart toaster that was so old that I can’t remember when I bought it.  It is not often that an appliance performs so well for so long so I decided to double down and I think I made a good decision. 
David,3 years ago,1,Toaster was scratched and scuffed. 
Charlee Stardust,a year ago,3,"I would have given 5-Stars except there's one problem - the SINGLE SLICE feature doesn't work.  Instead, it turns off toasting on one side of both slices (note: the right toasting lever retracts and powers two slices at a time).  So I bought another Cuisinart 4-Slice Toaster with the same feature, and it too does not work.  So much for quality assurance testing at Cuisinart!  I like this toaster except I am single and I normally don't need two slices toasted so it wastes electricity in that regard.  :( "
Toasted in Wilford,5 months ago,3,The push down levers need to be pushed down twice the get them to stay down. It will not toast homemade sourdough bread on a single session even when set to the highest setting. Darkness levels increase with continued use. This toaster is not made in USA. 
Geoffrey,10 months ago,2,Not sure about this toaster as I had to buy two to replace the one I had previously that lasted 4-5 years.. The mechanism that holds the handle down is difficult to engage on both the one I returned and the last one I purchased..Disappointing for sure. 
sueinca,6 months ago,1,"Find another brand. I have used Cuisinart Toasters for years because of Costco. But each one has been inconsistent with toasting. Some days you have to push it twice, some days it burns….all on the same settings. Time to return this one. "
FDierker,a year ago,5,"Great toaster. Performs as described. As a recommendation, I would run it at its highest temperature a few times after purchasing as there is quite a heavy chemical smell that needs to burn off (for us it was gone after 2-3 days use) "
Ronni,2 years ago,4,"This toaster is OK but takes some getting used to. It sometimes under toasts and sometimes burns, but I think I just have to figure out what number to put it on after something is on the Defrost setting. Otherwise, I think it's fine. "
James,2 years ago,5,Don't have any complaints really.   When you push the lever down you do have to make sure it clicks to start heating.   It seems to only fit normal or small slices if you have thing thick you would have to cut it like a large bagel. 
mmichlle,2 years ago,4,"Nice toaster. I have to put my bread down twice to actually get it brown, and it does have a little quirk, where you must click the lever into place, if you just push it down it won't toast at all with out that click at the bottom. "
Camille6,a year ago,5,"We love this toaster so much we decided to get a second one for our son. It has buttons to push depending on if you’re having bread, bagels, waffles, pastries or english muffins. Plus dials 1-7 on how toasted you want your food. "
Wanda,2 years ago,3,The toaster is nice looking free shipping and the price was right but it toasts unevenly so if you’re looking for uniformity- this isn’t for you. It gets the job done and looks good- you’ll be satisfied enough just not wowed… 
Bruce,25 days ago,2,I returned it.  It took 2-3 times pushing down on the handle to get it to catch and start toasting.  Then when it was done sometimes it wouldn't pop up enough to know it was done.  The quality just wasn't there. 
Shady Toast,2 years ago,1,I will be returning after one week. Two things a toaster needs to do well. Have good consistent temperature settings. Plus even browning on both sides of bread. It does neither. The bad reviews were spot on. 
Rose,a year ago,2,Temp control fail results in burnt toast on 3/medium level. Single slice option still heats 2 slots- misrepresented option .  Missing a removable panel at base to clean.  Cheap quality at a cheap price 
Jen H,6 months ago,5,"We bought this toaster for ourselves (millennials) and then bought one a year or so later for my Dad (boomer) and it is loved by all! Simple, easy buttons, toasts great, and has been really reliable. "
MGV1,2 years ago,1,We have been buying Cuisinart for a while. We use a lot. This one is not very good. The levers do not stay down. We have to try several times. I do like the buttons for the different types of breads. 
SYS00,2 years ago,3,"The very first time I used this unit to toast my favorite bread, Dave's Killer Bread 21 Whole Grains and Seeds, I immediately learned two flaws. One, although my bread is an average size, the toaster slot is a bit short in length such that I had to press the bread down with my fingers. Once done, the knob doesn't come up all the way as it should, so it forces me to press the knob up. This toaster has the weakest spring mechanism of any toasters I've used. Because it's so weak, it hardly makes any audible sound when toast is done, so if I'm away from the direct view, I wouldn't be able to tell whether the toast is done or not. If it weren't for the $10 discount, I'd have returned it. I've purchased Cuisinart products years ago, and I noticed their deteriorating quality control with recent products. "
RobertaMurphy,3 years ago,5,"Outstanding toaster that does all it promises to do-and is priced fat lower than an identical model on Amazon. Toast, bagels, English muffins and waffles all come out perfect. Thanks again, Costco! "
NHFos,2 years ago,4,Overall nice with good options for toasting.  Only complaint is that the slots are a bit narrow (some loaves of bread are a little longer so I have to squeeze it in).  But good product and brand. 
Anonymous,2 years ago,3,Why do you advise that toaster should be unplugged when not in use? Never had that warning before. Does not toast evenly. Felt that a Cuisinart product would be excellent. Disappointed. 
Waterbufflo,2 years ago,5,"Nice toaster, useful functions and good control once you figure out the toasting setting. Wished slots where about half inch longer so rye bread would have to be cut down fit. "
Sler,a year ago,4,"This is a good simple toaster with few bells and no whistles. No WiFi, no Bluetooth, just toast. There are a few buttons ( bagel, English muffin, bread) and that’s it. "
New Cuisinart owner,2 years ago,3,"It's a toaster, and it does the job. What I don't like is, it's too quiet. I want to hear the buzzing sound when it starts toasting, If I don't push the lever down extra hard, it will not start, I would like to hear it buzz, that way, I know it's toasting. It's also too quiet when the toast pops up, if I'm not keeping an eye on it, I don't know when it's done toasting because there's no sound. "
Nappy Jim,2 years ago,3,My first toaster had to be returned as the left side did not work So far the replacement is fine but feels  plastically and always must be on a higher setting 
fatherbob,5 months ago,3,"This toaster is a beautiful piece of architecture. But,  its primary function, toasting bread, it falls short. Here's the rub. The machine toast bread unevenly. "
Conan,3 years ago,5,"After a few uses so far, it works great and toasts to perfection.  No problems at all, compared to a cheaper one we bought a couple years ago and disposed of. "
MelissaRN,2 years ago,2,"We bought this toaster about a month ago. We find it toasts one side of the bread much darker than the other. It also feels cheap, for lack of a better word. "
Tete,2 years ago,3,"Its not white  on sides. Pictures deceiving . Also its huge. So bulky for a kitchen. I hate that. But it works good like any other toaster, nothing extra. "
Julia,9 months ago,2,"My old Cuisinart Toaster lasted years and never burned anything. This one burns every time, both sides are not working. Unfortunately returning it :( "
Rizwan Ali,2 years ago,2,Everything about this toaster feels cheap. Have to push the lever down multiple times for it to click. The finish looks nice but dents easily. 
Laem,2 years ago,5,Toast shades are perfect as well as the waffle and English muffin settings.  The best part: it doesn't beep like everything else in the kitchen! 
Yali,2 years ago,5,Great for a family of 5. My old toaster was kind of slow compare to this one. It also has different settings and my children love doing bagels. 
bewildered,5 months ago,1,like most all toasters this one only toast on one side. Doesn’t anyone make a toaster the=at is capable of toasting your bread on bith sides? 
wiggie805,2 years ago,5,"I bought this toaster about a month ago, and it is perfect.  It accomodates bagels and regular bread.  The 4 slots make it very convenient. "
Toast,6 months ago,1,"It burns toast on setting #2, which should get the toast only slightly brown. Using setting #3 totally smokes the toast to a black char. "
Roman22,5 months ago,1,Toasts unevenly. Makes no noise when toast are done. Bread sticks in slots. Not much to like about this toaster. Sorry we bought it. 
WaltzJo,2 years ago,5,This is a very good toaster.  The size and flexibility are great.  Love the setting for bagels. And the the other settings too. 
Nina,2 years ago,5,"This toaster works great.  It toasts very quickly, even if the bread, bagel or muffin is straight out of the freezer.  Love it! "
Pjlynn,3 months ago,1,There was something stuck to the inside of 2 of the slices. Started toasting and house filled with smoke . From the burn off. 
Jolene,7 months ago,3,"Its nice looking, but it doesn't always click down fully and fails to toast the bread. It stays down without toasting often. "

Richard in Colorado,2 years ago,2,"I bought this toaster because...A. Costco sells only good productsB. The Cuisinart name has a good reputationHowever, this toaster has disappointed me. My complaints with it are...A. The toast comes out with one side looking OK but the other side looking somewhat burnt.B. The toaster does not seem sturdy but instead feels cheap and flimsy.So, with Costco having such a great return policy, back I go to return it. Sorry Cuisinart.Richard in Colorado "

Mish,2 years ago,1,"Bought this cool looking toaster to replace a 2 piece Krupps model I’ve had for 20 years(!). This 4 slice toaster doesn’t catch the first time you plunge the bread in.  Figured this out after many morning of coming back to the toaster to find raw bread.  Also provides two-tone toast x one side overly dark, the other, under toasted. If I hadn’t tossed the box, I would have taken it back months ago. Save yourself the disappointment and buy a different toaster "

greenie,3 years ago,2,"for store bought frozen bagels, i guess this would work.disappointed that the slots would not accommodate a hand made bagel that was cut and frozen.  Previously had a Cuisinart until it broke. Cant find a decent replacement with all the features this one had. :-(   this would be a great toaster for someone that buys frozen bagels or waffles etc..from the supermarket that would have uniform size.  This would be great if the openings were a bit wider. "
Rufus,4 months ago,1,"I have several Cuisinart products and have always trusted the brand, but this toaster is cheaply made junk. The build quality it terrible. It feels thin, light and flimsy. The bread never stays down when I push the handle down the first time. I have to SLAM it down, and it feels like it's going to break. When the toast comes up, one side is burned and the other is barely toasted (No, I'm not on ""bagel""). I expected better from Cuisinart and Costco. "
Chris,10 months ago,2,"Beware, this toaster smells like something is burning the first several uses, at least ours did. Smelled like paper or breadcrumbs on fire but we had made sure it was empty and free of packaging before plugging it in.  It seems to have dissipated after several uses but that's never happened to me when using a new toaster before.  Other than that, nothing special, just an average 4 slice toaster.  I will probably buy a different brand next time. "
Sha Stew,2 years ago,1,"Box was delivered with a large hole punched violently though it's side. Two of the three heating elements did not turn on during first use, leading to bread only toasted on one side. None of the control buttons worked out of the box. This product us a complete failure! Top of box was retaped shut, as if this was someone else's returned item that was reshipped to me. News flash..., it didn't work the first time and it still doesn't work now. "
Mick,3 years ago,2,"For the price of this Toaster ,it did not seem to be solidly constructed . I thought I ordered white but received stainless ,not sure who's actually at fault on color mix up . Bottom line didn't seem worth the price "
Amy007,9 months ago,1,"This toaster has levels 1 through 7. I can't imagine anyone ever needing to use anything higher than two, because things burn any higher than that. I guess level 7 is incinerate. With the amount of toast, pastries, bagels that I've burned with this toaster, I could have bought the more expensive toaster that automatically lowers your bread that I was trying to replace. Do your wallet a favor, and pass this one by. It's not worth it. "
Raeleen,a year ago,1,"I am VERY DISAPPOINTED in the Cuisinart toaster; the levers you push down are very stiff and they don’t catch, unless you push and hold them down, they pop right back up.  The toasters settings are not the best they don’t automatically go back to default; you have to remember to take it off your last setting.  I wouldn’t buy another one; I would have returned it, but I didn’t want the hassle of shipping it back to Costco. "
Dano,a month ago,2,"I love the features and functions with this toaster, but it only toasts half the toast or bagel. The lower half is barely toasted compared to the top half. If you adjust the toast level higher to compensate for the bottom half, it burns to top half.  I wish I could give it a higher rating because I like Cuisinart products, but this is the second one we bought which has the same problem. Definitely a manufacturing defect. "
Avel,2 years ago,3,"In general, we like this toaster - I mean, it's a toaster, it makes toast. Has an attractive appearance & nice choice of settings. However, one of the slots toasts darker on one side than the other, and the lever on the right side needs to be shoved down with a good bit of force to engage. So we've gone back to find our toast not even started... Also kind of miss the 'done' bell. Going to exchange the unit this week. "
software_dude,9 months ago,1,"What a disappointment. The build quality is horrid - 2 elements already failed (after just a few weeks), the lever is hard to push down and have it stick, you always have to fiddle with with / push it a few times. It has hardly been used. I used to think of Cuisinart appliances as quality - heh, not anymore. Congrats to the MBA who pushed to save $0.29/unit - at the cost of their reputation. I'm done, never again. "
Tina,a month ago,3,Cuisanart quality has really gone downhill as they seem to focus more in looks. This looks very nice in my kitchen but I don’t like how it stays lit for a while after toasting is done. It makes it seem like it is still being toasted. The lever to push down is very flimsy but you really have to push hard to click it to work. Sometimes it lights up like it is toasting but we realize it did not click down all the way 
Bob2421,2 years ago,1,"This is a great looking toaster, with 2 dumb issues: 1) the bagel mode requires flipping halfs, which is counter-intuitive and stupid, and 2) in the single slice mode, it works exactly like the bagel mode - i.e. turns on outward sides of two slots, instead of both sides of a single slot. Dumb, dumb, dumb. I bought it on sale, and it was cheap, but every time I'm near it, I feel dumb for having this dumb appliance. "
ES90265,2 years ago,3,This toaster is ok. I needed the one for four slices and the choice was not that great. My major complain is that it heats up bread sides unevenly making one darker than the other regardless of the program I choose. The spring that makes bread pop up is rather weak and does not do it’s job. It is not Brocken but the construction and parts seem to be too cheap.I consider returning it. 
Merri,2 years ago,5,"I already had two other Cuisinart small appliances and I love them.  They work well, are dependable and reliable.  I’m a big fan of Cuisinart and that’s why I selected the toaster and so far it lives up to my expectations.  It has separate toast shade control on each side and they are true to the shade of toast I select.  I’m very pleased with the function and looks of this toaster. "
Bear,a year ago,5,"After many faithful years, our Kitchenaid 4-slot toaster finally failed. The Cuisinart replacement was ranked best in performance by both Costco shoppers and Internet ""experts"". Over  the first several weeks I learned what settings will product toast to my liking and it has functioned well with easy to use controls and with easy to clean crumb trays. So far, so good... "
Edward,3 years ago,1,"You can’t use it with any bread that has nuts or raisins or any added ingredients. 80 percent of our toast is from bread with these ingredients, what do we do? "
LisaS,3 years ago,4,"Worth it! I first attempted to replace my old toaster with a small, inexpensive 2-slice toaster. I guess you get what you pay for-as it only toasted half of the toast. Returned it and decided to buy this toaster, as I used the same one at work several times. Although I really didn't want a large, 4-slice model - I was very happy with my choice. Definitely recommend! "
Francis,2 years ago,2,"Out of the box it did not work properly. The buttons are not responding the way they should. I wanted to use bread, but when I press ""Bread"" the left side only offers ""Bagel""  so I can only use the right side. So I cannot toast four slices of bread at the same time, since the left side only offers ""Bagel"". I guess this unit should not have passed the quality check. "
Barb T,2 years ago,4,"This is a good toaster. It is a bit aggressive in its toasting. I keep it set just below 3 and it gets a little on the darker side and toasts one side more than the other regardless of the setting (I use bread, not bagel). So it is uneven. However it is efficient and I like that if you pull up on the lever, it brings the bread up higher to remove. "
Giuditta,2 years ago,4,"I replaced my Cuisinart toaster that I bought at Costco 4 years ago.  The new toaster is not made as well as my old one.  It doesn’t  always seem to catch when when I press down on it.  Also my husband doesn’t like the knobs.  He prefers the old toaster that slides.  One advantage, is that there are new settings for waffles and English muffins. "
FreeFlowAZ,11 months ago,1,"This toaster does toast. That is why it gets 1 star. Other than that, the worst. When you push the levers down to toast, you have to push them down more than once for it to stay down. To toast bagels, they have you turn the pieces around and some bagels don't even fit. I don't think Costco bagels fit. I really wish I had our old toaster back. "
Charlie C,4 months ago,2,"Never thought I’d hate a Cuisinart product but this toaster feels like cheap junk. You can barely tell when the lever is pressed enough (doesn’t quite “click” in) and it feels like the lever is going to break off as you press it.  The two sides toast unevenly (on same settings), and sometimes only one side of the bread actually gets toasted. "
Butterscotch,3 years ago,5,"The price is steep for a toaster, but once we started using it, we realized it was amazing. You can toast 4 slices at once and you can toast two different types of bread at once (english muffins, sandwich bread, bagels, waffles or pastry). Beware that if you're toasting only one slice, then one side of the bread will be more toasted/burnt. "
Eric,4 months ago,1,"You have to almost double push the lever down for it to stay down, this is what finally broke on the one side for us. Toasted item doesn't come up all the way, you have to push lever up to try and grab what you toasted. Its does toast quickly, just not sure if lever issue is a manufacture defect. I read another review with same problem. "
Joe R,2 years ago,4,"Solid toaster. I mean it toasts lol. Not sure all the toast settings are all that different tho. But it’s a great looking toaster to have on the kitchen counter. Only downside is it easily collects finger print marks so if your a neat freak you will be constantly wiping the smudges off this thing. Other than that, it’s toasts. "
Buckshot57,a year ago,5,Love the toaster and the variety of settings. The only negative thing about the purchase is the shipping. I ordered the toaster as a Christmas present. The warehouse just stuck the shipping label on the toaster box. When we came home the box was on the porch and it was pretty obvious what it was. No Christmas surprise. 
no name,a year ago,3,Our previous toaster was also a Cuisinart 4-slice toaster that we liked very much. The new ones toasts just fine but we are not as satisfied with it because it is hard to get the lever to lock when you push it down and when it is done toasting it doesn't pop up very much so it is hard to know when the toast is ready. 
David,a year ago,5,"It was time to change my toaster. I love this toaster. The many options for types of toasting and width and how deep the bread and or bagel can go in the toaster is a perfect size. But the option for single toast or cancel are great added features. Compared to other toasters with similar option, this price is good. "
Catju,2 years ago,1,"No sound to let me know the toast is done. When I press the lever down, it needs an additional push to make it toast. Sometimes I think it's toasting but it actually needs an extra push to make it toast. "
Gloworms,5 months ago,5,"We have made the complete circle of toasters, toaster ovens, large ones, small ones to none.  We decided we needed a simple toaster again.  This one meets the need. It’s quick, and it produces the perfect piece of toast. Toaster strudel etc.  we have not experienced any problems.  I say it a good purchase. "
Teresa,2 months ago,5,"This is a great toaster, had purchased 1 in the store a couple of years ago and it works great still today. It is a little expensive my husband complained about the price but after using it for some time it’s well worth what we paid for it. So I purchased another for my son when he moved into his new home. "
John,6 months ago,1,"Ordered the toaster, delivered damaged. Costco decided to send a second one without confirmation and the second one was damaged worst than the first one. What a challenge to try to return with UPS and Costco in line. Finally took both back to warehouse and resolved the issues. Still do not have a toaster. "
EinColorado,7 months ago,4,"Toasts well. Sometimes too well. Watch those numbers on the dial. As with many appliances these days, they have to be all techy. I don't need that. Just give me a good toaster and I can judge how to cook myself. We had a similar Cuisinart before, that's why we bought anorher after the old one looked worn. "
G Lamb,2 years ago,4,"Overall upgraded to a 4 slice toaster and has worked great! I have found that when you you “single” slice function, one side of the single slice spot heats up and one side from the spot to the left heats up. Most likely wires got mixed up. Even though it has this flaw, I still recommend this product. "
Mom of 3 boys,8 months ago,5,This is my third time buying this toaster .. I have boys and they are pressing that button down too fast and it broke every year. Luckily it has a good price so I keep coming back for it. It’s not the best quality but it does the job if you have multiple kids in the house! Great buy for the price! 
Marianna,4 months ago,1,A piece of junk. It takes me three or four times to toast one piece of bread. The single slice does not work. I am replacing an old toaster whose knobs fell off and broke. This one does not toast any better. It’s only advantages are that has its full knobs. Next time I will look for another brand. 
arri guy,3 years ago,3,"The toaster seems to not want to ""pop"" the bread up far enough to remove the toast.  You have to push up on the lever that you push down to toast the bread to allow the bread to move up so you can remove the toast.  Also the cord is short and does not restrict as the directions say it will. "
Ciao Ciao,2 years ago,5,"This toaster is great, very functional, with presetting for bread, bagels, English muffins, waffles. I liked when I toasted bagels, on the machine, there was a picture telling me put the inner bagels outwards, the result was fantastic, inside of bagels had nice brown color and very crispy. "
Katiejo,2 years ago,4,"I have used this toaster a handful of times. It works good but sometimes one side of my toast isn't as done as the other side. I tried an english muffin in it and it worked fine. When I tried a poptart it almost burnt but I just needed to turn the dial down. Overall, it is a good toaster. "
Harley Jim,2 years ago,5,"Great toaster for the price. Has so many great features that I didn't have before. So far it has been working great as it can defrost frozen bagels, etc. & then toast them to your liking, both items just by making the push button selections & then pushing the lever down. Very satisfied! "
Torrance Steve,2 years ago,2,"Do NOT recommend. Will not toast evenly on both sides. You must eject and turn each piece of bread half-way through the cycle. Both sides have this problem and the settings don't help. Also, the ""Single"" button does not turn off the unused side, so no help there. Buy a better brand. "
Melissa,2 months ago,2,"Don’t order through warehouse!  I ordered this 2 times and both came in a very damaged box with holes in it. The product itself is nice, but the slots for bread are not as wide as I would have hoped for. If you have a big fat bagel, you will have a little bit of trouble space wise. "
Susan,4 months ago,2,"This toaster is not as good as the last 4 slice toaster we boght from Costco.  It doesn't eject the toast up very far.  The different setting do not toast items as well, some things have to be toasted a couple of time to get them a little brown even if you change the dial setting. "
White fang,2 years ago,2,"It makes good toast.  However, the toast lever does not easily catch when pushing down so toast is often not ready and must be reset when I discover it has not cought.  Single slice button lights 2 slots negating the single slice feature.  The toaster is functional but imperfect. "
Nana,a year ago,5,We love this toaster! We had bought a Cuisinart toaster after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and absolutely loved it. One side of it went out recently so we knew that we wanted another Cuisinart similar to it. We were happy that we found this one. Love all of the features that it has. 
AZAlice,2 years ago,4,"This multi-function, metal toaster has settings for bread, bagels, waffles, pastry, and English Muffins. The right side even has a single slice area. The knob is easy to use. The only downside is that the indicator line on the knob is hard to see. That is why I gave it 4 stars. "
Kimmysuewho,7 months ago,5,"Perfect toast every time! Couldn’t be happier with my purchase. I bought this to replace a toaster oven that took over 10 minutes to toast a piece of bread. Now within 2 minutes or less I have hot, perfectly  browned toast. Excellent toaster that looks great on my counter, too. "
Mrs Beasley,8 months ago,5,I bought this toaster as I’m gluten-free and my husband is not. We didn’t want two toasters so this was the solution. Now we don’t have to worry about crumbs and stuff cross contaminating my side. We use a toaster slot cover. Works well for us.Love all of the features. 
LeeB,2 years ago,1,Just returned this product. I only expected one thing from this item….make a decent piece of toast.  Total failure. Uneven results. One side barely browned. Top inch of toast remained uncooked. Every setting failed.  Poor quality control. I expect much more from Cuisinart 
ilovecostco12345678,5 months ago,1,This toaster I recently bought sparked and almost caught on fire and smoked up. Very disappointed and have been nervous since because my older child who is independent would sometimes use this for waffles. Could have been a serious threat. Disappointed to say the least. 
larry27,2 years ago,5,"Now this is a really good toaster,  It is sturdy and solid.  I has different buttons for bread, bagels, waffles which is nice and also a defrost.  The slots are nice and wide.  Not expensive compared to single models.  I really like it and would highly recommend it!! "
Jaycor,2 years ago,1,"It was slow, and toasted very uneven! It was large and bulky! "
Schmer71,2 years ago,5,Works great. Easy to clean with the 2 pull out trays. If I had to criticize anything it would be the darkness selector. If they had extended the selection line from the side to the center of the knob it would be much more obvious. I used a sharpie to do just that. 
Michael,2 years ago,5,"Operation is smooth as ""Butter"" the dials rotate so smoothly along with all of the options. Just a note of interest, if you're annoyed with finger prints purchase the white version. I purchased the stainless it prints up very easily. However its no issue with me. "
Ed Mead,a year ago,4,"I would give it five stars were it not for the fact that the toaster is made for yesterday's size bread slices. The breads I use today are wider, which takes a little stuffing to get them into the toaster slots. Otherwise it does it's job well, toasting bread. "
lizzie,2 years ago,1,"The control to push down the bread never worked right, and finally broke and wouldn't stay down at all. The toasting was very uneven--one end of the bread very dark, the other end light. I had high hopes for the Cuisinart brand, but this toaster is not good. "
C Oas,a year ago,5,"This toaster does it all - bread, bagels and even pastries!  Toast fast and everything is perfect without changing the darkness knob. So much better than my last toaster that cost 3 times more and burned out after 2 years. It sure pays to shop at Costco…… "
BethMT,2 years ago,1,Bought this a month or so ago to replace a toaster that was toasting unevenly. This isn't much better and it can take several tries to get the lever to engage so it will start toasting. Not convinced the waffle setting does anything. It's going back. 
IbraE,2 years ago,1,Not good. Returning it. 
Nicole V,2 years ago,4,"I just purchased this toaster yesterday after reading all the reviews.  Most of my small appliances are Cuisinart, so it is a solid brand.  The single toast feature did not work, not sure if i will pack it up and try another one or live with it! "
john,a year ago,1,"I just opened thr box to find the is very short! almost 14 in shorter than our existing toaster of the same style and brand. I will return to local store asap. the toaster looks to be very nice, but with this super short cord I can not use it! "
Happy in Tx,2 years ago,5,"Step up in quality build, esp for the price. Heavy, restaurant quality. Lots of toasting options. Only trick is you have to ""click"" the button down into locked position before it will toast. Only need a 3 on the dial to get light/medium brown. "
Floorwhisperer,2 years ago,3,"The price is right, but quality control not great. The single toast function does not work. And a couple of the hearing coils never turn on in any mode. We plan to keep it—it still toasts things—but out of the box it’s not fully functioning. "
billjsd,2 years ago,3,"upon opening the box, found the body to be less substantial than our previous Cuisinart 4-Slide toaster.  The mechanisms are flimsy, the heating is slow.  I don't give this a chance to last more than a year, when our previous one lasted 8. "
Linda D,3 years ago,5,"VERY GOOD TOASTER, CUISINART IS NEVER A DISAPPOINTMENT. THE TOASTER HAS MANY CHOICES OF TYPES OF THINGS TO TOAST, IT HAS GREAT TOAST DARKNESS OR LIGHTNESS NUMBERS TO CHOOSE FROM AND IT TOAST THE ITEM BEAUTIFULLY ON BOTH SIDES AND EVENLY. "
Anonymous,6 days ago,1,"Opened the package to find the toaster covered in greasy grimy fingerprints, missing a handle, and strange masking tape with Chinese writing.  Will be returning it tomorrow. "
Debbie,4 months ago,2,"We have bought two of these units and love the features. However, they fail to toast both sides of bread evenly. We decided it’s better to purchase a cheaper unit that lasts a year than buy this unit which doesn’t toast evenly. "
Elly S,4 months ago,5,"This is a terrific toaster. I had a huge toaster oven than beeped 3x very loudly when the toast was done. This toasts perfectly, even the bagels and no beeping!! Also takes very little space on the counter. Highly recommended. "
Andrew,5 months ago,2,"1 Single slice feature does not work, 2 you have to push lever twice for bread to stay down in toaster 3. Led lights stay lit after toast is done so if u don’t hear toast pop up your have to go look as u can’t rely on lights "
Dave,6 months ago,5,"It looks good, it works good.  The only thing I miss is a countdown indicator, so I know when it’s about to finish.  The timing between each side is perfect, i.e., set both sides to 5 and they both pop up at the same time. "
Helen,2 years ago,5,This toaster makes amazing bagels you just have to put them in the way it's telling you to. Never have I had a toaster that had so many different features. So far so good everything's been delicious and toasted just right! 
JerryC,2 years ago,4,"First one arrived with damage, box and toaster. Promptly resolved by Costco. It toasts well however some of the selection buttons do not appear to make any difference in how it toasts. Especially the single slice setting. "
Kelly P,2 years ago,5,Love my toaster! The stainless steel cleans up so nicely. My kids are having fun exploring all the different settings. I like that it is so compact and doesn't take up a lot of counter space like the previous 4 slice did. 
John,a month ago,4,"Great toaster; love the options and settings.  I really like the ability to choose from as few as 1 slice of bread up to 4 slices; yes... 1, 2, 3, or 4 slices of bread/bagel not to mention the ability to defrost as well. "
Tammy,2 years ago,1,I bought Cuisinart toaster last year after a year the button stop working- so had to get a new one and this is not working properly from the beginning--what a tribble quality--instead of getting better is getting worse. 
Grandad,a year ago,5,"This machine is above and beyond just toasting bread for breakfast.  Not only that, it looks amazing in our kitchen.  Hope you enjoy yours as much as we have enjoyed ours.  Good luck and hope to see your review soon. "
Jim Ster,7 months ago,4,Works efficiently. It’s a basic toaster but I didn’t realize the outside slots in the toaster bin burn hotter than the inside ones for bagels so I cremated the outsides and under toasted the insides the first time. 
jeffw,3 years ago,2,Toaster does not toast bread evenly. Also not consistent when set at certain level. Looks nice but not the quality we expect from Costco or Cuisinart. Will return and hope they carry another 4 slice model soon. 
PingPongPrince,3 months ago,2,Since the beginning I wondered why I had to turn it to 6 to get a medium toast.  Now only half the heaters glow and just tonight my wife said the waffles are coming out cold. Hopefully Costco will take it back. 
Joni,2 years ago,2,This toaster looks great and is easy to keep clean. I promise I know how to use a toaster- but this is difficult to use and has too many settings. The lights stay on too long. It is not intuitive to use at all. 
David Perry,6 months ago,5,"Great product and price.  Did Not like the fact it was shiped in a box showing what it was just like you find in a store, it was left on the front porch in plane site luckey it was still ther when I got home. "
Keto chocoholic,2 years ago,5,"Reliable, works well.  Love the bagel setting for sandwiches. Bought to replace an older toaster.  I had used this model of Cuisinart before and really liked it so I knew what I was getting. Highly recommend. "
Signengis,3 years ago,2,"I don't like it.  It toasts ok, but it takes a couple of hefty tries to get the toast to stay down.  I haven't figured out how to dial it up so I can set it and forget it, and the pop-up button doesn't work. "
Bob D,3 years ago,4,As good or better than any competitor on the market. Looks good on the counter top and delivers toast and bagels exactly as intended. We are very pleased with the price we paid and the product’s performance. 
running from Gnats,2 years ago,4,Great toaster for the price.  However I had to give it only 4 starts due to having to work at getting a bagel slice which was cut very thick out.  Not really the toaster's fault but it was a lot of work. 
Tracy,3 months ago,2,"Delivered damaged. Returned in person, but had to reorder online. Second delivery damaged, but this time the item was not. UPS should be held accountable for damaged goods! Inconvenient to say the least. "
Dave G,3 years ago,2,"Appliance is more of a ""burner"" than a toaster. Options for different types of food to be toasted are interesting, as are option to set toasting level from 0- 7.  Anything over 1 or 2 burns the food. "
OkSana,4 months ago,3,I’m not sure why but one side never actually starts toasting but need to slam handle kind of hard for it to actually activate the toasting option.   I’m not happy!   Feel like I’m going to break it soon 
Ardnas,2 years ago,5,"Have only had the toaster for about a week, but so far all is good.  Toasts both sides of bread well which our old toaster never did and toasts buns perfectly.   Have not tried the other settings yet. "
Curtis,5 months ago,3,Great toaster. But ordering online sucks 1st 1 came box destroyed called in the sent another 1 thank you 2nd came box has punched hole in side of box.  Costco please choose a better deliver service 
Mary,a year ago,3,"This is a great four slice toaster. My only issue with it is that the cord is on the front/side making it extremely cumbersome and awkward. Had I known that, I would not have purchased the toaster. "
iowagal,2 years ago,4,"I like the toaster and I like the different settings. You do have to watch it, one side tends to get brown faster than the other. I just pop it up and turn the item over and continue toasting. "
Sacto Girl,a year ago,5,"Excellent toaster!  I wanted a regular toaster without all the bells, whistles and digital gadgets on most of them now.  This one is perfect. I use it daily.  Very satisfied with the product. "
DD12,5 months ago,5,"I needed a toaster to replace an older Cuisinart 4-slice toaster that broke, after 15+ years of use.So far the new toaster has been working great, and is a good upgrade from the old version. "
Richard M,3 months ago,5,"I love this toaster. It's energy efficient.Instead of turning on all four slots, it only heats the pastries that are inserted. It also has many options that are conveniently placed in front. "
Robin,3 years ago,5,Love the toaster but it was not in a box just the original toaster package which was  all torn and mashed in.  luckily it did not dent the toaster . Very sloppy packaging most disappointing 
Cles,3 months ago,3,I have this brand before but unlike those this toaster does not toast well. I was so disappointed. I had to purchase a different toaster elsewhere to have a decently toasted piece of toast. 
JTAT,5 months ago,3,"Takes time to figure out settings for each kind of bread, bagel, waffle etc. Everything toasts between 3 and 5. Doesn’t lift bread high enough to remove after toasting without bread tongs. "
Ford,a year ago,5,"Great toaster. So versatile and customized settings for bagels vs. English muffins vs. Bread ...etc, actually work to perfection, unIke others I've owned. One day delivery. Can't beat it. "
Zayir,3 years ago,3,"Looks awesome! Inconsistent browning of toasts, no audible indicator when toast is done. Reviews are in comparison to the Kitchen Aid toaster we had bought from Costco about 4 years ago. "
zenzin,3 years ago,4,"So far it's been great. The levers which lower the bread sometimes don't catch the first time they are lowered, but that may be my fault. Will update if there is an issue in the future. "
Thunderider,9 months ago,2,The housing on the toaster gets extremely hot.  The functions are confusing and don't seem to work as designed.  The single function still has both burners working on the right side. 
Family C,2 months ago,3,The quality of this new toaster doesn't seem to be on par with the toaster of the same brand that it replaced. The bread down latching seems a little stiffer/not as easy to achieve. 
FayeAway,2 years ago,1,"Does not toast evenly, the ""click"" you hear and feel when you press down on the latches doesn't work right.  You have to really press down hard and not rely just on the click sound. "
MAKO,4 months ago,1,"It does not work properly. It is very inconsistent—sometimes it doesn't heat, other times it burns. Cuisinart makes good products but this one is faulty. I am planning to return. "
Wabbitt,3 years ago,4,"Works well, attractive, useful features. Light weight, kind of tinny. Toast does not pop up very far, smaller slices (like raisin bread)  don't pop up far enough to easily grab. "
Laurie B,2 years ago,4,You have to program up to 3 buttons and set temperature before toasting. This is too complicated for my husband. All the LED lights stay on for a few minutes after toasting too. 
Adam,3 months ago,5,We have only had this toaster for about a month but so far it’s exactly what we wanted as it works so well. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great quality toaster. 
Very happy customer,2 years ago,5,I love my new toaster! I can pick and choose if I’m toasting one or two slices of bread or if I’m toasting pastry or bagels…It even has a defrost button!It’s so convenient! 
Gijoe,2 years ago,5,"Aesthetically nice looking.  Many features not found on other toasters.  Even toasts on one side if you select that feature.  Nice toaster, at a reasonable price from Costco. "
Bob G,a year ago,2,Does not toast well.  It is never consistent.  One side of toast is good while the other side is burned.  If it can’t do normal toast we’ll all of the other options fail too! 
Toasttie,2 years ago,3,"Inconsistent results. Lots of settings but it's still ""luck"" as to getting desired shade of toast. Not much better than 12 yr. old Sunbeam we retired but it is more compact. "
Conchita,5 months ago,5,The family loved the 4 slicer toaster and with a name like Cuisinart we knew we were getting quality.  So far we are loving the features and settings and the easy use of it. 
Gerry,3 years ago,5,have had it for two weeks now. like it a lot. faster than old sunbeam and the four slice toaster doesn't have a much bigger footprint on my cabinet than the old two slicer. 
Alwyn M,3 years ago,5,Toaster works fine. I like the choices for toasting different types of bread.  Due to finger prints on toaster I wish I had a white one.  Wish the crumb trays were deeper. 
Sandee,3 years ago,5,"I've only used the toaster a couple of times but so far so good, it seems to be working like a charm. I've toasted frozen bread, toasted a bagel and its come out wonderful "
Harry,2 years ago,2,You have to really push the lever down super hard or it won’t start browning and put the number up to 4 or above for it to brown. Sometimes you have to push it down twice 
Sandy,3 years ago,4,"I have found that I have to push the lever down, set the setting such as bread or bagels and then push it down a second time. It’s not a problem as long as you’re aware. "
nancy,a year ago,3,"The 4-slice Cuisinart toaster is nice looking and does not occupy a lot of space. I found that it toasts quickly and quietly, but it over browns at a low setting of ‘2’. "
SalNeuf,3 years ago,5,"I thought about giving it a 4 because it seems a bit flimsy; however, I decided on a 5 because of the way it toasts so evenly. After all, that is the bottom line for me! "
Steve,a year ago,1,Toaster us cheap garbage.  Cuisinart used to be a quality brand.  Not any more.  Costco is damaging their image if selling high quality items if they stay with cuisinart 
Carol,2 months ago,5,"Great toaster, it has so many options and works very well.  I wish Cuisinart would come out with the double long slot toaster again with the same options as this one. "
Anette,7 months ago,3,My older model Cuisnart toaster worked much better & easier to use settings . It seems cheaply made not like the cuisinart brand name we’re used to sorry to say. :) 
JerryInPhil,2 years ago,4,"Does what it is supposed to do, Toasts Bread. Best feature besides a nice appearance is that you can dial in exactly the degree of toasting that fits your palette. "
Dock,2 years ago,5,"This toaster is fantastic! Bread goes in, and in just a few minutes, poof, TOAST On the downside it's not wifi enabled,  so my alexla cant make toast for herself. "
Benny,3 years ago,5,Looks very nice and works well. Multiple settings allow for getting toast just like you want it and the wide slot makes it easy to do bagels and similar pastries. 
BJCC,2 years ago,4,It toasts perfectly but the pop up spring is tight and does not raise the toast high enough to easily grab.  I have to move the hand lever up to grab the toast. 
R1943,a year ago,4,"It is a nice looking toaster. the function are easy to understand. The only negative is it does not toast dark enough, even on the highest settings for muffins "
Couch,a year ago,5,We really needed a toaster 2 people could toast at. This works really well and we haven’t had any issues. It’s a good deal compared to what else is out there. 
Unhappy,6 months ago,1,It didn’t toast evenly and sometimes only on one side.   Our old toaster that we were hoping to replace was much better.  We returned the toaster to Costco. 
Jerry,3 years ago,5,"Beautiful appearance, operates as one expects a toaster should. Seems to be very well constructed. The biggest plus is my wife is extremely pleased with it! "
MelM,2 years ago,5,You can't go wrong with a Cuisinart product. This toaster met all my expectations. The cariety of settings made it ideal for many different types of breads. 
CarolynO,2 years ago,1,"Nothing works well: lever doesn’t stay down, right side didn’t warm up, doesn’t make a sound when done even when stand next to it you’re not sure when done "
Skydivevkc,a year ago,4,"Works fine, but timer seems to take a bit longer to reach our preferred level of toast than our old model, leading us to believe the coils are not as hot. "
Lynn,2 years ago,3,"This toaster is just OK.  It isn't the quality I was expecting from Cuisinart.  Very light weight, and you have to push the  controls are not easy to use. "
BakingMama,2 years ago,5,"Good quality, with many options for different types of bread.  The design is nice and sleek.    We would highly recommend this toaster for a large family. "
Annielouie,9 months ago,5,This is a great toaster! It is exactly what we were looking for! The only thing is that you need to make sure that the lever is in place when pushed down. 
B Thompson,2 months ago,5,I bought to replace an older four slice toaster. I am very pleased with this toaster. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a new toaster. 
Sherry,4 months ago,5,"Love this 4 slice toaster. Toasts evenly and easy to set to right level of toasting, on each of the two slide sides independently. Highly recommend it. "
Teresa,2 years ago,5,Toaster works great! We love the ability to do 4 things at once with different settings for each side.  The price was great through Costco.com as well. 
D Jones,2 years ago,5,"I really like this toaster, it has a good option to toast  items lightly. It is big enough for larger items and adjust to what you are trying to toast. "
BuffaloRunner,a year ago,2,Not at all impressed with this toaster.  Toast varies widely regardless of setting. Likely will send it back if they don’t give me a steep discount. 
DanF,2 years ago,3,"Toaster is compact, light with multiple settings however it doesn't toast evenly and you have to have it on a high setting to fully toast your item. "
PaMc56,3 years ago,4,"Toaster is what I would expect from Cuisinart and Costco.  Works well, easy to figure out new features.  Very simple to register the product online. "
Cheers,2 years ago,5,"Good toaster, husband is now self sufficient in making his own frozen waffles. The slice size is very good for the larger “normal” slices of bread. "
No Food Man,a year ago,5,"Had the same toaster for several years, and it still works good, but this model had a couple of more features at great price so bought two more. "
Genie T,3 years ago,5,"Nice looking and has lots of settings, which I really like.  I like the option of a 4 slice toaster and this is a very nice unit for the price. "
Mango,3 years ago,4,Lots of options. Sourdough bread needed two toasting cycles to brown. Easy to clean. Have only used bread and muffin settings. So far so good. 
VL1980,2 years ago,5,best part about this toaster is that I can toast mine and his at the same time to our individual preference. Love that bagels can fit as well. 
ExIllinoisKaren,2 years ago,5,Love all the settings but especially the stainless steel design.  Thanks to the Costco buyer for getting this great product to the customers. 
APack,3 years ago,5,Great looking and handles more then one of the options at the same time... toast on one side and bagel on the other with separate settings... 
Ramair,2 years ago,2,"Toasts one side even on bread setting. If you want a reliable high performing toaster, then I think a Waring is probably the only way to go. "
Anonymous,6 days ago,5,"Great toaster good price and fast delivery, I keep shopping with COSTO "
Donna,7 months ago,5,Appears to be a quality toaster and Cuisinart is an excellent brand.  Our old toaster was slow to toast and this one toasts pretty quickly. 
Valentin,3 years ago,5,So far this one has been good to me. The 1st one came defective and costco returned it and now i got a new one that has been working great. 
S Owens,a year ago,1,It’s terrible! The lever to lower bread is very temperamental and it toasts unevenly. I’ve already bought a replacement (not a Cuisanart). 
Islander,2 years ago,5,"Works great.  If you like dark toast quickly, set it to English muffin and crank up the heat knob for a minute or two.  Looks great, too. "
Reddmary,2 years ago,4,Lots of options to choose.  Toast comes out as requested.  The stainless steel looks great and I don't have crumbs scattered everywhere. 
Deb C,a month ago,5,"Love this toaster, it's smaller than my old toaster so it takes up less room. It has a wide range of cooking temps. Very happy with it! "
Kristi,3 years ago,5,Actually toasts bread on both sides unlike other models I have used. It works great and I love that I can do 3 slices of toast at once 
Bull,2 years ago,3,Muffins didn't get dark enough on highest setting. Don't like unplugging toaster after use. Couldn't find in manual where it said why. 
rodeonana,5 months ago,5,"We own one like this one, that was bought a while ago, this was bought as a Christmas gift, hope they love it as much as we love ours! "
Opsguy,7 months ago,5,"Use everyday. Settings are consistent. Dark is dark. Light is light. Like having 4 slots. Cook bagels on one side, toast on the other. "
Bill,2 years ago,4,"Had the toaster for a month now— so far so good. It works very well, as well as advertised any way.  We’re pleased with our purchase. "
Anthony,3 years ago,4,This is a bulky toaster so be prepared for it to take a lot of counter space. It works great though so very happy with the purchase. 
The Prof,4 months ago,2,I find that the mechanism that lifts the toasts does’nt lift high enough. I often have to reach inside with a fork to get my toasts. 
Ashley K,5 months ago,5,"I have been looking for the best value in a toaster. It needed to be 4 slice, cheap, and sturdy!! This toaster met my expectations! "
d71298806d,2 years ago,5,This toaster works as expected from cuisinart. I found it to be a little heavier than my old one but the extra options are worth it 
Chinny,3 months ago,5,"Simple, gets the job done. I just needed a toaster that didn’t burn one side of the bread while the other side was barely toasted. "
Kelly R,a year ago,2,Heating elementa were all jacked up.  Had to pull the wire off the plate to allow it to toast properly. It's still not perfect 
KTrinh,2 years ago,4,It not toast evenly like I thought it would for the price of the product ! It look nice on the countertop of the kitchen though 
Suzanne,2 years ago,1,Bought yesterday !Going back todayDead out of the box!Cuisinart could care less defective take back$30.00 gas wasted! 
Jcat023,a year ago,3,"I liked the idea of “his and hers” toast settings, as my husband and I battled over toast control with our old 2 slice toaster. We quickly noticed that the cook was inconsistent, so even though I ‘dialed in’ my cook number, I find I regularly have to push the lever back down for additional toasting to get it to my liking. Right off the bat we noticed cinnamon bread cooked differently than whole wheat, so after burning the cinnamon bread we had to start really paying attention. I’ve had the toaster for a few months now, used a few times a week (not daily) and have recently noticed inconsistent toasting on a single slice, meaning one side will be nice but the other will be light and partially cooked, so then I have to turn it around and put it back in.  the single slice option was good at first, but quickly stopped working.  Seems to fire up 2 slots even if using the single slice button. Not a huge deal just evidence the toaster doesn’t operate as described.  I’m disappointed we donated our ‘old’ toaster, which was purchased 10 years or so ago for like $9.99 or something.

ArtGalHouston,11 months ago,1,"Friend purchased 800 thread count Hotel last year from Costco and I loved the feel so I ordered for myself. Was very surprised when it arrived to find out it was not the same. It’s definitely not the weight, much thinner. The sewing not quality, feels and looks cheaper. I also purchased the 650 thread hotel cotton sheets. Same thing that not heavy or well made, do not look or feel like quality sheets. Very disappointed these are not as nice as the original sheets I saw. Good 800 thread sheets can be very pricey so when I saw the price, I pounced. If it seems too good to be true, there’s a reason for that. Save your money and don’t buy these. "
AZ Lady,a year ago,5,"Heavy weight with sheen and wrinkle free.  And the top of the sheet does not get wrinkled or fold on itself.  I love these sheets.  This is my second set. They come out of the wash like new.  You know they are quality the moment you touch them.  Compared to Sleep number sheets- there is no doubt the Costco sheets are better.  They have tags on the sides that say “side” for the bottom sheet so you dont’ put it on wrong.  The top sheet is extra large, so it is easy to tuck in and there is plenty of hang on both sides of the bed.  I have one wish however, I want to be able to buy the pillowcases seperately.  We need extra standard cases. "
Kflie83,a year ago,5,"These sheets are very nice. Thick and soft. They did have an awful smell out of the package,  but it quickly disappeared after their first wash. My last set of sheets were about $350, so I was a little nervous trying these. I am pleasantly surprised by their quality! The only thing I'd change besides the smell, is that they seem to be a little large. They aren't a snug fit on the top of the mattress, so there is quite a bit of extra fabric even with our very thick mattress. We have a Split California king though, so I'm thinking that probably wouldn't be an issue for other sizes. All in all I'm very happy with these sheets, and will be buying them again. "
,10 months ago,1,"I washed the set before using, and the side edges of the top sheet frayed a lot.  They feel a lot less wrinkle-free than I expected, and not as smooth.  Then I noticed fraying along the piping at the top of the sheet.  The fabric is disappointing also as it is not silky-smooth like some queen sheets I previously purchased from Costco and makes it difficult to slide the top sheet over the bottom, including making the bed.  The white is ""winter white"", not true white, if that matters.  The biggest issue is the poor workmanship that does NOT uphold the Costco brand.  I'm returning the set, sad to say, but it just does not work for me, and it's poorly made. "
Jasel,a year ago,5,"After reading all the reviews, I went ahead and ordered a queen set and a full set. Neither had the bad smells others wrote about. They did have a new/factory type smell that immediately went away after I washed them. Being that they are cotton, the fitted sheet is a little more snug after second round in the dryer. Might want to keep that in mind if you have a higher mattress (pillow top for example). The material is very soft and thick. The sides are labeled on the fitted sheet- ""side"" ""top/bottom""- very helpful! The blue one is a little more of a blue/green tone. Not a true blue if that's what you're looking for. "
Rosie1758,a year ago,4,"This is the second set of Hotel 800 sheets for me and I was hoping to get exactly the same sheets.  I own blue and I ordered blue again but they came as green/blue, not blue.  I kept the white but took the green ones back.  This set is 6 inches longer on the flat sheet.  The fitted sheet is really big.   My mattress is 9 inches but this probably fits 18 inches.  That leaves a lot of fabric to tuck in and it is hard to get a tight fit.   These sheets are heavy weight sateen and wash and wear well.  I have found that I have to dry the fitted separately.   I do like the fabric but I wish I could have the same sheet from a couple years ago. "
Ottosmom,a year ago,5,"For a long while I've been looking for sheets that fit.  I'm very picky when it comes to bedding. When I saw that the package stated that this set would fit small to 18"" mattresses, I said ""yeah"" right. I'll see.""  I have a 14"" mattress and have recently never been able to find a set of sheets where the bottom sheet wouldn't be nice and tight like military style. I opened the package and tried the bottom sheet to see if what they said was true. I was shocked!  They fit just right. Thank you Costco for saving my life and helping me to sleep better with these magnificent sheets!  Worth every penny.  I highly recommend them. They feel like silk and I feel so spoiled. "
JCWC,a year ago,5,"I've been buying these for myself and gifting them.  The 100% cotton fabric is substantial, soft, washes and dries well and adapts to body temperature, i.e., it's cool in summer and warm in our Northeast NYS winters so much so that I don't use our fleece sheets anymore. These are much better quality and at a fraction of the price from the ones I bought from a NYC borough-based company whose sheets are made in Israel... you can figure out who that is. My other sheets and pillowcases have been donated as they were in good condition, but these are terrific so they're the only ones we like sleeping on. "
Costco Fan,a year ago,1,"I bought this less than a month ago.  Washed it once before using it.  It's well made but it is not as soft or smooth feeling as I expected.  After 2 weeks of daily usage and 3 washes later, there are noticeable wear and rough patches on the fitted sheet.  Some parts already started to look thin and rough like it's been through 100 washes!  My previous sheets purchased from another big store (sadly they have been out of stock for many months) looked much better than this set even after a few years of daily use!  Totally disappointed with this product.  Regardless of the price, I do not recommend this product. "
Jen1,a year ago,5,"Not sure if the 1 star ratings here are referring to these 800 thread counts sheets - don’t see how that’s possible!  We use these in our Airbnb so they get washed at least 15 - 20 times a month…they’re great - cannot beat the price, especially when they’re on sale…even when they’re not, still a good value…don’t even look to see what 800 thread count sheets cost with 4 pillowcases at Pottery Barn or Macy’s or any linen store - at least 3 or 4 times more expensive.  Favorite part are the labels on the fitted sheet - “top or bottom” and “side”…so helpful when changing sheets as often as we do! "
Sad Sheets,4 months ago,1,"We have two sets of the Kirkland 680 thread count sheets, and love them. When these went on sale for the same price, I decided to give them a shot. To say I have buyer’s remorse, would be an understatement. From the second I unboxed them, I noticed significant fraying at all seams. I washed them and put them on the bed in hopes they would “break in” but they are quite stiff, not quite scratchy but also somehow not soft? I don’t even know how to describe them, honestly. They seem to retain body heat, so we will keep them (if they last) for the winter, but I’ll never buy them again. A true disappointment. "
EssAre,a year ago,1,"I bought these sheets 3 months ago to replace a 10 year old 800 thread count set that finally wore out. They are in rotation with 2 other sets, changed weekly, so these have only been used a total of 28 nights and washed 5 times on a gentle cycle in cold water. There are rough fraying patches in random places, and the top sheet decorative seam is fraying along the entire length. I would return them, but knowing they'll likely go in the landfill if I do causes me to hesitate. I invested in what are supposed to be high-quality sheets to have them last for years, not months. It is disappointing that these are already looking and feeling like they're ready for the fabric recycling bin. "
Edward,9 months ago,4,"The sheets are wonderful but the color as shown in the online photos is misleading; we ordered beige and the ones we received are a rather dull grey.  The online selection shows dark grey and beige, so we ordered the beige expecting to receive same, especially since both the 680- and 400-thread count sheets displayed in the Warehouse Store are truly beige.  The 800-thread count ones we received are more expensive but the color as shown in the photos is NOT the color we received.  Shameful deception... but we'll keep the sheets anyway because they truly are great sheets.  Won't buy this kind of stuff online again, though. "
STV121,10 months ago,3,"I purchased the California King set in ""Blue"".  I will probably be returning them as the color is horrible and I can't wait it with any other blue accents for this bedroom.  The sheets are very heavy feeling and thick which could be a preferable attribute for some but I find it just too much.  The top sheet dimensions are really inadequate for the width as I don't find there to be enough drape on the sides; it would probably be enough if there is just one person in the bed but I foresee a tug of war between two sleepers.  The fitted bottom sheet fits nicely and there is plenty of heavy duty elastic, all around, to keep it in place. "
MRKRZ2,a year ago,2,"We have brought Hotel Signature sheets in the past and had no issues, and were very happy with the product, the sheets lasted quite a while, but finally my wife asked me order  2 sets, one at a time to see if they still had the same quality. The first set was washed per instructions. We used and the sheets felt great.  Some time later and we washed them again, we were very disappointed, the flat sheet was coming a part at the edges, it had strings hanging out the edges. My wife had me cancel the second order, The quality and workmanship on this version of sheets is clearly not worth $120.71 tax included. We cannot recommend this product. I will say that we ordered online on 03/24/2023 and it was delivered on 03/28/2023. "
Lisa,a year ago,3,"were everything a quality sateen weave should be: Crispy, lustrous and soft. Then, during 2021 sometime I believe, after the sheets became nearly impossible to find, they re-released them but altered the ""formula"" and printed on the cover that the sheets were now  coated with an ""antimicrobial coating"". The sheets were so very un-impressive after that. But I don't see anything about a coating mentioned here. Did they stop doing that? Oh, I hope so and am going to try again, hopeful that I will get those sheets that I loved so much back in 2018-ish. Crossing fingers! "
Nichole,3 months ago,4,"If I had to describe these sheets in a word it would be “fine.” We bought a new, very deep mattress and found ourselves in need of sheets to fit…which these do. They’re also cotton which I like, but for cotton sheets they are weirdly shiny and kind of slick feeling. They wash well, but they wrinkle like crazy. Straight out of the dryer these are kind of a mess…and I have a set of linen sheets, so I know a thing or two about wrinkles!  The bottom line is we bought two sets of these and will probably only keep one while we look for something a little nicer. The price is fair for what you get, but don’t buy these expecting them to feel like high end sheets. "
sunvsmoon,a year ago,2,"These are great sheets while they last. Nice and thick material, tags on the ends showing top/bottom or side, and feel nice. However, we have now purchased them 2x and will be looking elsewhere as without fail after about a year, they end up starting to tear big time. We are not rough with them and wash them according to the instructions. Costco reviews don't allow pictures (not surprising as the website is way behind the times) or would otherwise post one. Also, the pillowcases are way too long and look really messy which is something that I overlooked because we liked them. "
Star,8 months ago,4,"I have a split cal king bed and the sheets I have been buying are $100 more per set so when I saw these sheets at Costco I took a chance on them.  The fabric is very nice.  One of the pillowcases had a stain on it. While the fabric is nice it is thicker than I am used to.  And the bottom sheets are very big.  Even with elastic around the edges, the bottom sheets do not fit tightly.  I know with an adjustable bed that can be a problem but, with the bed in the flat position the sheets are still loose.  On the plus side, the top sheet is oversized and is very nice.  Just made the bed so I haven't slept on the sheets yet.  I will update if possible. "
Shaweety,a year ago,5,"Love, love, love. I’ve spend way too much money of “high end” sheets over the last few years and have been very disappointed as some have shrunk to where I can not get them on the mattress. And, when I do, they come off in the middle of the night. (They were an expensive bamboo set). These sheets from Costco were on sale and I gave them a shot. Am I ever glad I did.  Tags showing side from end, love that. These sheets are done so well that even after putting them on my CalKing mattress, there is room left over with wonderful elastic on the corners. They don’t come off at night.  So glad I bought them. "
Emily,a year ago,2,"Sadly, these are not the same sheets we knew and loved from Costco ): I have ones I bought back in 2018/2019 and they are the best sheets- super silky and cool to sleep on. Then they were out of stock forever and when they came back in stock I was so excited to buy them but was disappointed. Same tag but completely different feel- feels cheaper/scratchier and they don’t sleep cool. Don’t waste your money. Shame on Costco for changing something incredible and going cheaper. "
eeclaire,a year ago,4,"I wish these had been available in the Costco Warehouse stores, because I really wanted to feel them and compare to the 600 thread count.  None the less, I was not disappointed.  These sheets have a soft and somewhat silky feel.  The bottom sheet is actually bigger than expected. As I compared it to other sets, this bottom sheet has deeper pocket corners so it is kind of ""baggy"" rather and tight and smooth fitting.  Not a deal killer, but that's why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5. Love the pillow cases for my king pillows.  Glad I made this purchase. "
RVSJM,a year ago,1,"After finally being available in King size, I ordered two pairs. Just like some other reviewers wrote, it is not the same quality. The material is so thin and doesn’t feel like 100% cotton, let alone 800 thread count. Beige and blue colors look so dull. Please bring back original quality. For reference, I have a queen sheet set from an year ago and it is still the best, think and soft. "
mandmca,a year ago,5,"We bought two sets of these sheets years ago and they are the ones we always use. Costco finally had them again and we just received them, washed them, and put them in our bed. They are so luxurious! Ordering more for my guest rooms now while they’re available! "
Cynthia,a year ago,5,We have always had good luck with Costco sheets. These are no exception. They look and feel great and they have really deep pockets with wide elastic at the corners so they don’t pop off when we sleep or put the head or foot up on our Cal King adjustable bed.  Don’t let the wrinkles out of the dryer deter you. As soon as the sheets are on the bed the wrinkles disappear. 
Carol,9 months ago,2,"I have similar sheets that I bought several years ago and bought a new set since they were on sale and I really liked the quality.  I just received them this week and got the sheets and pillowcases out of package to wash.  When I took them out of the washer,  I noticed dirt stains and some small dirt pieces sitting in the washer. (And I had washed another load of clothes before that so knew there was nothing in there beforehand.) Luckily, stains were mainly on the pillowcases so I washed them over after spraying some stain remover on but still did not get stains all out. Wish I could return but not sure since they have been washed. "
Bufford,7 months ago,1,"The material is high quality, the flat sheet fits, although it could be wider.  The pillowcases fit, no problem, but the ""fitted"" sheet DOES NOT fit.  It is too small.  What gives?  My mattress didn't shrink, but the fitted sheet did.  Shrinkflation?  P.S.  When I give a ""good"" review, I don't have to include my membership number, order number, or the date of purchase.  Why? "
mnkittycat,a year ago,4,These sheets are heavy-quality.  The deep pockets fit a 22”mattress and stay in place.  The only con is that they are not particularly soft.  I washed them before use and am hoping that they will soften with future washing. 
Jevin,a year ago,4,Purchased these sheets for our guest room. While you can feel the quality I noticed a lot of excess threading that we needed to cut off. Minor point but disappointing they were missed during QA inspected. However more disappointing are the wrinkles. Despite drying in the lowest heat and removing immediately (as well as only drying either the flat or fitted sheet one at a time and not all together) we still needed to iron the entire set. Even post guest sleep these sheets they were significantly wrinkled. Perhaps that’s what you get with high percentages of cotton and not mixed. 
LPlp,a year ago,3,"Proceeding time was 1 week then they shipped in 3 days. Just arrived. Upon opening the package, the white is clearly off-white. I checked and they're labelled white. Against my white washing machine they look pale yellow, and they nearly match a set of (intentionally) ivory sheets I bought for a different room. Although we have a king bed, we use standard sized pillowcases, so I bought separate white pillowcases and they totally don’t match. If you’re looking to match a true white, don’t get these! Lots of loose threads in the corners, too. "
NathanfromoK,a year ago,4,I purchased both the Hotel Signature 800 thread and Kirkland 650 thread sheets recently.Both are really nice sheets.I personally liked the Kirkland 650 better because the elastic around the corners are better made. 
OregonRed,a year ago,5,"These are worth every penny! Compared to other Costco sheets that are less expensive and ok, these are much heavier quality, very durable, comfortable, no scratchiness (I have very sensitive skin so this is important). Highly recommended. I've had a set for a couple of years now and they are still in excellent shape. "
Guest2222,a year ago,1,"I was really hopeful about these sheets and I kept them but they really aren't worth the money. The sewing quality is not good. End stitches are not finished, they are just folded in and threads are loose, they become even more loose after a wash. I expect better quality from Costco. Also, the pillowcases need to be enveloped. "
Mary PK,a year ago,5,"Don't know what those bad reviews are about! These sheets are the most amazingly comfortable and very well made! If these sheets tear with a errant ring then that ring must be like a knife since these are thick sheets but keep cool on my skin and I usually sleep hot. These sheets are wonderful and I would surely order them again. I got two sets and wish I had more room to have 2 more sets! They also send two extra pillow cases (usually you get only 2 but with these you get double, 4) so that is great.There may be some irregularities getting through the factory but I only saw my sheets as the best quality and no loose stitching or messy manufacturing If there is a defect this company would surely send a replacement but the best thing is to take defective product back to Costco. It's a win/win! "
Anonymous,a year ago,1,"Sadly the fitted sheet started to shred in 3 months. I really loved them because they actually stayed in place when I adjusted the bed, unlike other split king sheets I have. "
JWFL,a year ago,5,"I recently purchased a set and I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. The quality of the sheets is top notch – they are soft and cozy against my skin, yet durable enough to withstand multiple washes without losing their shape or color. The fitted sheet fits perfectly on my mattress and stays in place without slipping or bunching up. The flat sheet is generously sized, providing ample coverage and allowing me to tuck it in securely at the foot of the bed. The pillowcases are also a great fit and feel smooth and comfortable against my face. Overall, these sheets have exceeded my expectations in terms of quality and comfort. I highly recommend them to anyone in search of a good night’s sleep. "
CBM1,a year ago,3,"Just received these and they have a terrible smell. I have now washed them twice and the smell persists. They are not as heavy as the previous HOTEL 800 count sateen set I purchased which is disappointing. If I can't get the smell to go away, I will be returning these. "
Dorisel,a year ago,5,"I love this new sheet set.  Smooth and silky, plus no more night sweats. The color beige is subtle and comforting.  I hope it lasts 23 years, as long as my last sheet set.  I would consider it a great investment if it did.  Would'nt you? "
Kid Cracker,11 months ago,1,"So sorry, really wanted to like these sheets, but they are really scratchy even after washing them twice before using them. I returned them pronto 😳 "
Jan F,5 months ago,5,"I must have been using cheap sheets all my life. These were a revelation! I’ve had night sweats for as long as I can remember. Don’t know if it’s hormonal, polyester fabrics, or some kind of  . . . I have no idea what. Since I’ve been using these sheets I haven’t had any. Maybe it’s not even connected, but these sheets are heavenly. They’re soft and smooth; not too hot and not too cold. I’ve been getting the best sleep! Having the corners labeled is a bonus. Even with as many beds as I’ve made, it’s still mostly a 50/50 shot I’d get it right the first time. I bought two more and may  buy another. I know now that  life is too short for crappy sheets. "
Lori,8 months ago,1,"Upon opening the box that took 30+ days to be delivered from India, the smell was beyond toxic. That same smell radiated from sheets which meant I couldn’t fully open. I placed the box near my door for return and the entire room smelled disgusting. Put the box in my car trunk which radiated throughout. The smell continued right up to the Costco countertop to return. Don’t buy these 800 thread count sheets, the smell was beyond disgusting. "
Colleygirl,a year ago,5,"I saw the Hotel 800tc sheets online and decided to give them a try.  They are what I’ve been looking for in a sheet as I’ve tested many sets claiming to be “the best” (including Kirkland brand Charisma,PB & BBB) and all were either scratchy, thin, wrinkly, or overpriced. The Hotel 800 are a nice weight, do not wrinkle, and are very soft but not satiny.  I liked them well enough to buy a set for each bedroom and will probably buy more for backup since Costco doesn’t always have them online or in store.  They are a steal with the extra $20 off! "
Criz,a year ago,5,"Very nice, well made sheets.  They also last very well wash after wash - No pilling.  This is our second set after 4 years with first. They are still very nice just went for another set to make it easier for washing.   Highly recommend. Probably need to purchase on the website as it’s hard to find these  in the stores. "
Anonymous,9 days ago,1,"I rarely write reviews but feel I should. I bought 3 sets for 3 California King beds. The fitted sheets are made for a mattress that is like 2’ thick. Anything smaller and the sheets are loose and you end up sleeping in loose sheets.   No hotel in the world have I seen sheets so non fitted and oversized. I have deep mattresses too and the fitted sheets are still huge. If they want to advertise as a premium hotel collection sheet, then t they possibly should sell in different mattress thickness / sheet depth. Their method is to over size them which is a cheap cop out which makes the sheets seem very cheap. "
JMC525,5 months ago,5,"These sheets are truly amazing!! I love everything about them, starting with how they look on the bed.  I'm not sure I have ever owned such well-made sheets made with such a luxurious material.  They fit my king size bed really well and are very comfortable to sleep on.  Plus, I love that they labeled the inside of the fitted sheet with ""side or top"" allowing you to know how exactly the sheet was designed for the bed, making it so much easier to make the bed. I'm very tempted to purchase a 2nd set. I would easily recommend these to a friend. "
Matt,a year ago,5,"We LOVE these sheets. We had a set of them a year or two ago and they held up well but unfortunately got slashed by an errant ring. At that time, we couldn't find another set of them, so we got another set from costco... which were cheaper, but we didn't like nearly as much - not as durable, not a great texture, and started to fall apart after just a few months. When these became available, we ordered another set of them to make sure they were similar, which they are, so we ordered two more sets to have as backups for the future! "
JimsBabe2621,a year ago,3,The fabric is heavy.  I have purchased Costco sheet sets in the past and really appreciate the four pillowcases in the king sets.  This purchase was for the beige split king set.  They do wrinkle significantly more than other sets I’ve had in the past.  That is my biggest complaint.  They do not look good coming out of the dryer. 
Jenx,a year ago,5,"I’ve bought two sets and my partner and I love them. They feel like good quality hotel sheets. After I put a freshly laundered set on the bed and crawl in, they feelso good. The quality for the price can’t be beat. I honestly don’t understand the other bad reviews. "
LauralB,a year ago,1,"I should have read the reviews! Think durable fine grit sand paper! These are not soft cotton sheets. I mistakenly thought I could soften them up with fabric softener and a couple washes, wrong. These sheets are very rough feeling. Well made but not at all soft like Egyptian or pima cotton. Only buy these if you want to be exfoliated! I’ve returned the 3 sets I didn’t open. Had to keep the one, since I washed them. "
Dee S,a month ago,1,"The sheets arrived a few days earlier than expected.  I received them on a Saturday, washed them as instructed prior to use and put them on our bed on Monday.  The first thing I noticed was threads hanging from the flat sheet.  I cut them off in order to avoid them getting worse.  On Tuesday morning, I saw there was a several inch long tear in a pillowcase.  Rather than asking for trouble, I returned them to the Warehouse for a full refund.  I thought the HOTEL SIGNATURE name suggested high quality.  In this case, it did not. "
Dan51,a year ago,5,"My wife and I slept on a set of these sheets at a vacation rental and couldn't wait to get a set for our own bed at home. The sheets are substantial, and have a crisp feel to them. Just a great quality set of sheets. "
lucky11,a year ago,4,"I love these sheets--except this batch didn't come as soft as the last.  Perhaps they will soften after more washes, but the previous orders were softer, more luxurious from the start.  Otherwise, these are the best sheets, much better than the 400 count by the same maker. Especially nice are the placement tags, which help with folding the bottom sheet.  They fit and wash well. More colors would be nice. "
ScottBK,a year ago,5,"Best sheets for the money! So comfortable and luxurious and they really hold up over time. I wish they were always available at Costco. When you see them, do not hesitate—buy them!! "
Frank,5 months ago,5,"The only Cal King sheets we've bought for the last few times. Soft, slippery feeling and fit like a glove with lots of tucking-in room. The only issue was our rough feet tend to wear out the lower part easily. I'd recommend rotating the feet and head ends to get more wear in the long run. Otherwise, great! "
Canadian Snowbird,a year ago,3,"When my King Cal set arrived, I was very disappointed to find the elastic had come away from one corner of the fitted sheet. There was a gap of about six inches. It was too complicated to return as I wanted them for my US home, but I was using a Canadian credit card with a Canadian billing address. "
AE Costco Shopper,a year ago,5,"Wonderful soft sheets in a nice different light teal color.  Super comfy sheets with 4 pillowcases for king size.  They wash nicely and look great.  800 thread count is perfect.  The regular price was 30% less than I would have paid for a similar sheet set that was “50% off” at my local department store.  I bought these from Costco because the Kirkland sheets I have bought in the past were sold out. These were even nicer than the Kirkland sheets, which I also love. "
kay58,a year ago,5,I am very happy with these sheets and plan to purchase another set. 
suzi,a year ago,1,Bought 2 sets of Hotel Signature Sheets Both of the fitted sheets ripped in the middle!! Could have been a bad batch. 
MezaJarJarBinks,a year ago,2,"We were surprised to find that the top sheet is TOO SHORT!  Why would you make a fitted-pocket bottom sheet that will fit thick mattresses, and then make the top sheet too short to tuck in? Thankfully, my wife has the skills to salvage the material from an older top sheet. She had to cut and sew about 12 inches to the new top sheet so we can tuck the top sheet in at the foot of the bed. Other than that, the material feels and looks fine. Just don't look at the patch at the foot of the top sheet. "
OPIS,10 months ago,1,Our sheets lasted about a year before thin patches appeared followed by actual tears. For the price one would hope to get more use out of these sheets. These are just not what they used to be. I have several queen sets that were purchased years ago that are still in great condition. 
Sues,a year ago,1,This is my third pair of these sheets. I have always loved them. Not so much with this pair. They are sloppily made. I bought Queen size and they are too big. The bottom sheet is way oversized so they are not snug on the bed. 
Bad Sheets,a year ago,1,"Very rough feel for a 800 thread count sateen weave, the packaging it came in literally reeks. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. I can't believe Costco carries this product. After the first wash the dryer lint trap was full, It's like they weave this from recycled dryer lint. "
PattiG,4 months ago,4,"We like the feel of the fabric of these sheets--not too soft and wimpy and not so crisp they make noise when you move.  I've had both of those and have returned sheets costing more than twice as much as these.  The fabric is cut mostly on the straight grain so they don't ripple or wrinkle at the hems and they are nicely sewn.  The fitted sheet is ample enough to fit a very deep mattress and the corners are easy to maneuver over the mattress.  I also like that the top sheet is long enough to comfortably tuck into the bottom of our Cal King.  They could definitely be wider by 10"" so they cover our sides better when sleeping.  All in all, good sheets for the price. "
Casey,4 months ago,5,"I was so glad to find these sheets in a Split King size which is hard to find, especially in a box store. We recently moved and upgraded all of our bedding and these sheets are simply amazing! I love how thick they are and I've washed them twice and each time they wash they become more and more buttery soft. I was pleased that the king set included 4 pillowcases. We have 4 king pillows, 2 with shams to match our quilt - but I like to switch out the pillow cases mid week for a fresh feeling. I'll definitely be buying these again for other rooms. I wish they were available in more colors that match our emerald green bedding. "
Beemo,5 months ago,1,"We loved these sheets when we first got them because of the fit and quality of the stitching. We loved them so much that we bought a second set and set them aside until such time we would need new sheets.  Within a year or so, big rips started occurring on my husband’s side near the bottom. We threw the fitted sheet away and decided it must have been caused by a callous on his heel. We put on the second set and he started taking care of the callouses. Less than a year later the new fitted sheet started ripping at the bottom on MY side!  And I don’t have callouses!  You can see how thin the fabric had worn just from some tossing and turning. I’ve never had this happen before with any other sheets I have owned. I would never buy this brand again, which is a shame because the stitching and fit were superior. I think we should get more than a year out of a set of sheets. "
Rick51,a year ago,1,"Stitching was falling apart. When we opened bag, it had an awful smell which we had to wash. After the wash we noticed the corner threads were falling apart "
Teri,10 months ago,5,These are undoubtedly the best sheets we have ever tried. We’ve tried every sheet company and style out there. We either the return them or donate them. If you like a cool slinky feeling sheet that is also crisp and non-wrinkling these are the sheets for you. 
Cathy S,a year ago,5,The quality and feel of these sheets are amazing! We have bought several sets! We also really appreciate that the sides and top/bottom of the fitted sheets are labeled-- such a simple thing that makes bed making easier! 
Rita,10 months ago,2,"I’ve had a lot of difficulty in finding California King sheets in a beige color, so had to buy these as desperately needed them. Color was fine but otherwise would not purchase again. I unpacked them and there were various threads hanging loose. Also there was a caught thread on one of the pillowcases. If I didn’t have to use them straight away, I would have returned them. The flat top has very little overhang on the sides, you wouldn’t be able to tuck in if you wanted. although the length is fine. The fitted bottom seems to have shrunk in the wash (cool wash only and cool dry) so one side will now not tuck under the mattress. After two washes there are other pulls and snags in the cotton.  Needless to say, after a long search for the size, I will be replacing them with something better. On with the search! "
Allison,3 months ago,1,"Tons of loose threads on all pieces in the set at the seams. The pillowcase seams are not sewn well at the opening end with the stitching already pulling apart there. I requested a replacement set due to the defective sewing, and the second set was just like the first. Fabric is not as soft as I would expect for the thread count. The quality of these sheets leaves a lot to be desired. Both sets were returned. "
Honest reviews,a year ago,1,Started pilling after the first wash so dumb just buy the Kirkland brand ones instead. 
Sue H,a year ago,3,"Good sheets.  They did not skimp on size.   But don't expect amazing softness. They have been washed twice.  Again, nice enough but not a big wow factor on the soft factor. "
Pathfinder64,4 months ago,5,"I've only had them for a little over a month, but so far they're great.  So much so, I bought a second pair.  The fabric is absolutely great.  Very sleek without being slippery.  The construction is awesome. I love the tags that say short or long side, and the elastic is very strong.  I have an adjustable bed where you can raise/lower both the head and the foot.  My last sheets would always have the bottom sheet come loose when adjusted.  These sheets have such a great elastic that they never move. I've only washed them a few times, but so far they are holding up great. "
Kate813,a year ago,5,"These sheets are the loveliest ones I've found in about 50 years. They are soft but crisp, wash beautifully and the fitted sheet has elastic all the way around, so they stay in place. I only buy white sheets due to the lack of dyes that can cause stiffness. These are just wonderful. (I have 3 sets.) "
Steve,a year ago,5,"Bought these sheets on sale. Great quality and super comfortable.  Knowing what I know now, I would purchase these sheets at full price. Fitted sheets are oversized as promised and top sheet is abundant.  We have a split king adjustable bed and the sheets do not slip or ""pop off"" the mattresses. "
Olga,7 months ago,1,"First use after 1 wash and there is already a hole in the fitted sheet!! They gave a great feel but the quality seems poor. Hate to return, but they are too expensive to be this bad "
Comfy and Chic home,a year ago,5,Soft and cool! I returned my scratchy brooklinen sheets which were twice the price. I love these sheets so much. I had them 15 years ago when I was a teen and re-ordered them recently hoping they were just as good as I remembered. They are even softer and cooler than I hoped for. 10/10 
Brenda Corum,a year ago,5,"This is the second time I have purchased these sheets for myself.  They have to be the best, soft, quality sheets for a fantastic price.  I have also purchased these sheets as gifts with great praise from the people who received these.  These sheets last an incredible amount of years. "
oldhoss,11 months ago,1,"after on wash seam started fraying, and was very rough......... and not silky smooth as expected.thanks Costco for your return policy "
156LYS,3 months ago,1,"Purchased Hotel Signature 800 thread count sheets. Very disappointed with these sheets after the first wash and dry.  Threads filled the dryer lint trap and were all over the floor, when the sheets were taken out of the dryer.  Upon further inspection, threads were fraying out of the king flat sheet's turned seams. This is totally unacceptable and shouldn't happen with expensive sheets.    Will return.  Noticed other people had the same issue. "
Sbw258,7 months ago,1,"The sheets are soft, but when we opened we saw a black stain on the fitted sheet and assumed it would just wash out. Unfortunately did not, so we will pursue a return. A bit disappointed since this is our first time ordering a bedroom item online. "
Suzie,9 months ago,1,"The website said blue color but when I got it it was sea foam green. But besides the color discrepancy, there was a strong odor that resembled dirty rag. The box that it came in was also very dusty and torn. Why would I want to buy such an expensive linen that have these issues? Costco needs to pay more attention to clean and proper shipment services to get my business! Every time I had ordered from Costco, they ship in dirty. torn, and dusty boxes and I had enough of these kinds of poor shipment practices! "
Costco Shopper,a year ago,5,"With a high thread-count, these lusurious sheets feel very soft and comfortable "
Jamie,3 months ago,3,"The sheets seem to be made well. They are soft yet sturdy, however, as I have a King-split pair the corners tend to pop off about 4 days into my sheet rotation which is quite frustrating. I have been purchasing sheets for my specialized mattress for the past 4 years from Costco and the quality has gone down (and the price has risen). I still have a pair that are soft and a bit thinner, but also more breathable and those corners stay out for longer. These sheets aren’t worth the cost. Costco went backwards when developing these sheets, at least for the beds with the split king feature. Bring the old sheets back! "
TigardMom,5 months ago,4,"First, the good:  this is the best-fitting fitted sheet I've ever had.  The elastic is over 1/2"" wide and enclosed in fabric, and all corners fit all the way over and under the mattress, which is 13"".  The fabric is heavy enough to resist excess wrinkling, and come out of the dryer in pretty good condition.  The CA King (and probably the regular King) comes with four pillow cases.  I haven't slept on these yet, but I anticipate it's going to be fabulous.The not-so-good:  One of the pillow cases has a 13"" long flaw that must have happened during weaving, and that should have been caught.  The top sheet is not wide enough to tuck, yet is probably three to five inches longer than needed lengthwise.  Make these sheets wider! "
SDnc,7 months ago,4,"I've bought several sets of sheets from Costco over the years.  They are always great quality and well priced.  I usually buy the 400 thread count but saw the 800 on sale so I decided to try them.  They are definitely more substantial, with thicker fabric and just feel like luxury sheets.  However, I noticed that the top sheet is not as wide as the 400 thread count top sheet, which isn't a total deal breaker, but is still a shame.  Also, the thicker fabric seems to not breathe as well, so I feel too warm sometimes while sleeping.  These are minor issues, as I'd definitely buy these again, but worth mentioning. "
,a year ago,1,bought 2 sets of these sheets about 6 months ago.  The elastic around the bottom has failed and the sheets wad up on the bed nightly.  Fabric is OK; however the construction is terrible.  DO NOT buy this product. 
Lillian,a year ago,2,Sheets are thin not reflecting the 800 thread count being marketed. Thin threads were likely doubled to reach the 800 number. A true 400 Egyptian cotton thread count would probably wear better. Disappointing 
Kellie T,a year ago,1,"I purchased these in January, it is now the beginning of April and they are already showing considerable wear, I shouldn't have to buy sheets every 3-4 months. I'm very disappointed with these sheets. "
Designer Edith,10 months ago,5,These are the most luxurious sheets we have ever owned!  They are a nice thickness and almost wrinkle free!  I love that Costco sells a split king set!  We just bought our first split king mattress (two XL Twins) with separate adjustable bases.  These sheets are just so perfect for our new bed! I just wish we could buy pillow cases separate from the sets since we have 6 standard pillows instead of four kings size pillows. 
Trahance,11 months ago,5,"The quest is over. These sheets are great: smooth, soft, thick, and wrinkle-free. The closest sheets to the kind they have at the Hilton that I’ve found. I recently bought and returned a $189 Queen sheet set from another store because they were rough feeling. Returned another set from Home Goods that were so thin that they ripped when I pulled the corner over the mattress. Rhese sheets were keepers. The only thing that could make them better is if the pillowcases had the extra flap that fits over the pillow end to keep it in place; then they’d be perfect. "
Pete,20 hours ago,5,"Smooth and cozy. Maybe a little extra material which is really nice. Only down side, they are heavier than expected. Perfect winter sheets. "
Teresita54,a year ago,1,"I purchased these looking forward to a very high quality product. Instead I received a set of sheets that looked like they were sewn by a someone that doesn't know how to sew. . There are open seams, crooked sewing and plenty of loose threads.  This is not the quality I would expect from Costco. I will be returning them. "
ItsMe,4 months ago,5,"I have purchased these sheets over a period of years, back when they were regularly $89.99.  They are strong, thick, smooth and absolutely wonderful. If you like light thin sheets these aren’t for you.  I have purchased sheets of all prices and thread counts over many years and none compare to these. No pilling, no change.  Wash after wash, year after year, they are still crisp and like new.  BUT the colors offered are pretty dull, ugly and boring so i only buy the white.  Other than that i only buy these.  They bring four pillowcases but of course they are king pillowcases, and I wish they also offered pillow cases separately so i can buy standard since we don’t use king pillows. "
Bearsmaggie1,4 months ago,4,"Thick material that makes me wonder if they will be cool enough in the summer. Other than that,  a great product that went on our split king easier than most. The fitted bottom sheet actually has puckers on the seam that contribute to a better fit. I wish the top sheet was a little wider, my husband is 6/4” with broad shoulders and he takes up a lot of material when on his side. The color is rich and elegant really. I would definitely purchase again. Great price on special, but with the quality I think it would be a great full-price item from Costco. I don’t know if Costco has a Wedding gift registration option for couples, if they did, I am sure these sheets would be on the list. "
Greg,a year ago,1,These sheets are not soft and smooth.  They feel more like high grit sand paper.  I returned them. 
Anonymous,2 months ago,1,"When I opened the package the sheets felt stiff.  Like they had starch in them.  I washed the sheets before putting them on my bed to see if that would make them softer, which unfortunately it did not.  They still feel like they have starch in them.  I have bought sateen sheets from Costco before that were soft and just lovely (they don't sell those sheets anymore).  These sheets are not.  Also, I bought these sheets online.  It took at least two weeks before they were delivered. "
Joyful,a year ago,1,"These are no the same as the sheets I bought many years ago, returned them. "
Jeff,8 months ago,1,These high end sheets sold by Costco were a great disappointment.  The flat sheet had a stain blotch in the middle of the sheet.  The fitted sheet had two (2) loose or weak thread blemishes which will eventually become a hole(s).  It has become clear why these sheets were a sale.  Obviously Kirkland was trying to push these reject sheets off on to their customers.  Very disappointing!! 
Susan,7 months ago,1,The sheets had a very strong chemical smell to them. I returned them 
dab1,10 months ago,1,Poorly stitched. Two washes and thread is unraveling on seams. 
Andrey,3 months ago,1,"Purchased end of May 2023. Today is the start of March 2024, and the sheet has a giant hole in it. Pillow covers hold well, but the sheet lost its original look and now appears extremely warn out compared to pillow covers. "
Marie,a year ago,1,"These sheets felt great and kept us nice and cool, but in all my years of having dogs at home and having many different types of bed sheets, this is the first pair that has ever ripped on me. I have two large tears on the edge where my dog where my dog jumps on and off already and have only had them 2 months. Never had this happen before so it’s disappointing. "
JanS,4 months ago,1,"We washed these as soon as they arrived- sadly 3 seams on the flat sheet immediately frayed.  We thought perhaps that was a ""one time"" thing and washed the set a 2nd time....all within a few hours.  On the 2nd wash the seams of the fitted sheet began to fray and the seams on the fflat sheet frayed even more.  RETURNING this set to Costco- very disappointing- and we should have read the 1 star reviews before purchasing- many others have experienced the same thing. "
RemRose13,8 months ago,1,"For bedsheets that are priced over $100, we were expecting the quality to be very nice. Not only did the bed sheets smell like death upon opening them, the threads are already coming undone. Very disappointed. "
Anna,a year ago,3,"I ordered the queen set because over 15 years ago I bought them in store and they were very high quality. I was a bit disappointed with the lack of velvet feel to these sheets. The fitted sheet is not a tight fit--you have to tuck it under the mattress. I have a mattress topper and yet the fitted sheet's elastic isn't taut enough, but it's large enough to be able to tuck under the mattress. The regular sheet isn't long enough to tuck into the mattress sides, which may be because of the 3-inch topper I use; such a weird mismatch of sizes. I wish I could upload photos here, which I took for other customers. Overall, they are good basic sheets but not the luxury sheets I remember. The material is thick enough that it feels it will last a few years. "
Maggie,9 months ago,4,"Nice sheets!  I’ve only had them for about 3-4 weeks & washed them 2ce, so I gave them a four star until I see how long they last. I ordered & received a 2nd set based on how comfortable the first set feels.  If both sets are still comfy & useable after 9 months to a year, I will consider increasing my rating to a 5.  The bottom sheet is a little large on the bed because our mattress is not as thick as the max thickness for these sheets.  They wrinkle some when washed & dried, as do all sheets that are 100% cotton.  However, a comfortable night’s sleep is more important than wrinkles in the sheets! "
Paul,9 months ago,5,"These sheets are extremely nice. They are super soft, thick quality, and generously sized. We have a ridiculously thick mattress and they fit perfectly. We had previously made the mistake of purchasing dream fit sheets for $150 because nothing else would fit, but they were absolute garbage. Rough texture and they only lasted 3 years before they wore through. These are so much nicer, we’re only $80 on sale, and will most likely last a lot longer given how thick the material is. These are all I will be purchasing going forward. Thank you Costco for doing it again with your amazing Kirkland products! "
Jbh69,10 months ago,2,"Based on the high thread count, these sheets are really not that soft after the first washing.  the fitted sheet is adequate for our very deep mattress size.  The sheets are also heavy/thicker than what we are used to making it a warmer sleeping environment. Hopefully the sheets for soften up as additional Washing to take place. "
Jgirl,a year ago,5,"These are substantial, luxurious sheets - just the quality and softness you look for in sheets, and they dont wear thru like more expensive brands. "
Gippy,4 months ago,5,"I ordered both Blue and Dark Blue as I was unsure of the exact color and these are not offered ""in store"" at my Costco.  In person, both Blue look Exactly like the picture (on my computer).  I would say both fall into the ""Slate Blue"" color familyBlue is light (not baby blue) just light slate blue.Dark Blue (not navy blue) is what I'd call a dark slate blue. I dont see where to attach pics but they both go well with Gray and Cream tones. "
Patty Cake,a year ago,5,I LOVE these sheets! I couldn’t get them for a while so I was excited to see them again! I told a friend about them and she bought them as well. 
Mmry,9 months ago,3,"I was happy to see the bright white color. Also happy with the fit - especially since we have a cal king mattress, and typically the flat sheet is the same as for a king and therefore hangs way over the sides. This one is the right size. The feel of the sheets, however, is rough and hot, even after washing. The price was great, but since this is something we spend half our life on, I’m going to return them and invest in better quality elsewhere. "
AZIGIRL,a year ago,5,Great sheets...so soft.  The label the sides and tops so you do not have to worry about how to put the sheets correctly on the bed. 
LPK86,a year ago,5,"Beautiful to sleep on, launders nicely, good thread count-I have them on three beds in the house; reliably perfect sheet. "
Carrie,5 months ago,4,Not as soft as the last Hotel Signature 800 thread count sheet set that we purchased from Costco a few years ago. 
KayK,9 months ago,4,"I normally buy the Kirkland brand sheets (love them!), but I really needed a blue color, so I upgraded in price to the Hotel brand. Now I see in many reviews - the blue has a green tint to it. I think it will still compliment the room. Strong smell when package was opened, but after the initial wash, not an issue.  Nice touch with the seam on the flat sheet and pillowcases.  Love that you get 4 pillowcases (bargain!) with king. Only other negative are the seam / strings visible on the pillowcase.  This should be sewed so you cannot see this.  I will try and attach picture. Overall 4.5 out of 5 "
Terry A,a year ago,1,after washing sheets and attempting to put on bed for the first time we noticed a significant hole where the stitching was not done correctly.  Had to remove sheets and take them to a local seamstress to be repaired and sown properly 
BDigital,a year ago,5,"Really impressed with these, will buy again when we refresh our linens. "
peggyg,a year ago,1,"Washed the sheets, got them on my bed, found a hole in the fitted sheets. Hence they are going back to Costco. Never even got to use them. They felt nice…but—I’ll stick to the 680 thread count I’m used to. Never had a problem with them. "
Anonymous,a year ago,5,I would recommend this product for a thick mattress. 
jknopo,5 months ago,4,"These sheets are smooth and soft. They have a substantial feel without being heavy. The blue color was better than I expected, a comforting icy steel blue. I would given it a 5, but the fit is not quite perfect. The top sheet could be wider and it's too long, hanging onto the floor. "
JEL425,a year ago,5,"Soft, comfy sheets. Would definitely recommend! "
Todd,a year ago,5,"Crisp, smooth and iron easily! "
Catherine,10 months ago,5,"So often these days, sheets come out of the wash with the edges twisted.  It makes it difficult to make the bed correctly.  I miss the days when you sent sheets to the cleaners and they returned ironed.  But these sheets come out of the dryer straight!  They feel great too. "
Ajf1,9 months ago,1,"I read the reviews a thought I’d take a chance on these sheets. Washed them before putting them on the bed. Not only did they feel like sandpaper, one corner on the bottom sheet was split open. Costco, you have to do better than this. So disappointed. Definitely returning. "
Gaby2001,3 months ago,1,These are horrible quality. The 800 thread count is a trick because these sheets pill even if they are high thread count. The seams were falling apart upon arrival and a pillowcase came damages. Do yourself a favor and buy the Costco brand. It’s a lot better constructed. 
Fendi,a year ago,1,"I bought the tan 800 count cotton Sateen bed sheets from Costco as an online purchase. The stitchy is awful. The stitching is not finished on the ends and they are loose everywhere. On the end of a pillow case, the pillow case is coming undone. I just bought them literally. I haven't even washed to put them on my bed. I just opened it to inspect before throwing them in the washer and placing them on my bed, when I see like a oil Stain. Ewww, what the heck is that. I feel the fabric and it immediately I can tell that it isn't 800 count cotton. I have a comparable and based on tough not needing to compare, I still go and compare. These are not 800 count 100% cotton. Not to mention the fraying on the sheets and the embroidering line towards the top of the bed sheet that is meant to fold down on is ugly and poorly done. This is supposed to be the only detail of the simple bed sheet and you have one of its thread starting from one side and leaping on across the other side of the embroidery. There is also an area where it's bunched together. Very poorly done.  The casing/packaging in which the sheets came in is crappy. Not the same packaging I used to get when buying bedsheets from Costco before (Supima 800 count 100% cotton in white king size bed.) Had a difficult time taking the sheets out of same color and material bag that it came in with cardboard pieces which is covered by a thin plastic wrapping that is closed by an adhesive line strip (something I would use to package and portion homemade cookies in). What a hassle it is going to be folding everything and try to repackage it.  Also, writing this review feels like more of a waste of time but I think it something that needs to be written.  What a hassle. Very disappointed. I spent so much time trying to purchase good bed sheets and went with Costco because I trusted there judgements with products, but this one is a failure.  Please I advise not to buy, I wouldn't buy until Costco provides a better product. "
Maggie,2 months ago,3,"The pocket Corner construction is what I look at in a Quality sheet that will last the frequent washes and making and unmaking of the bed....The straight vertical seam of the pocket has an elastic strip to make the corners fit without gapping however....those places are sewn together with ONE line of stitch, and over Selvidge edges that had not been finished out before sewing together....this is going to make those corners weak....and the fitted sheet will likely develop holes along those vertical seams at the corners....A real shame too because the fabric is really a quality fabric and the seams and edges on the other parts of the product appear to have been sewn together with care and correctly. "
nonaB,4 months ago,5,"Received these sheets and washed prior to first use.  Was pleased with the not wrinkled look when they came out of the dryer!  After sleeping on them for a few nights, I love these sheets!  Feel good, not too hot and not too cold.  Would highly recommend and will definitely buy again.  Great price.  Also really pleased with the generous sizing.  Fits my high mattress with more than enough room on all sides. Elastic all around on fitted sheet.  Bottom and top of fitted sheet have a tag indicating top/bottom so not searching for proper side.  Also came with 4 pillow cases.  That's a bonus! "
Lisa,a year ago,4,"Great sheets but huge pillowcases!  There are 2 sets of these giant pillowcases that would only fit a huge pillow.  I’ve never had this problem before.  Also, I think I prefer the corners on the 600 thread count sheets and I think they may be just as well made (and soft).  I bought these on sale but if they weren’t the same price, I would choose the 600 thread count. "
Andrea,5 months ago,3,The sheets are super soft and fit our mattress well. The only problem is they are not wearing well. The fitted sheet in particular is getting very thin and even started splitting/tearing at the “foot end”. I believe they are just over a year old. 
Monica,a year ago,4,"I love the feel of them and I am way more comfortable sleeping in cotton sheets.Minor complaints are the pockets could be another 1"" deeper. They barely go around my mattress. This is my third time buying 2 sets of these sheets. In the prior ones we would get pilling from my husband's heels after a few months. This time both sets had pilling after one week on the bed. May be time to replace my husband. 😀 "
ro123,2 months ago,1,The first set I ordered had flaws in the fabric in both the pillowcases and the top sheet; I returned them and Costco sent another set. One pillowcase on the 2nd set had sub-par sewing and the fabric was twisted. Returning them. 
mep65,3 months ago,2,"When I first opened the box they came in, I was overwhelmed by the horrid smell--like a combination of drycleaner chemicals and very bad body odor. I even set them outside in the frigid cold for hours to get some of it to dissipate, as I started having a bad asthma attack. Fortunately, the smell went away after the first wash. The sheets seem good quality but are a little heavy/stiff for us. We have a split king, adjustable bed and although the fitted sheets fit well, the flat sheet was way too big. And I wish the pillowcases weren't so huge--they literally could fit a crib mattress. "
emurph,a month ago,3,"I was hopeful that I'd love these sheets, but they fell short for me.  The fitted sheet is too roomy and feels sloppy to me.  I like it to fit tight.  The top of the flat sheet is great, it does not wrinkle or roll up.  It's plenty long from top to bottom, however, it's short from side to side, I can barely tuck it in and the sides do roll up, so that we lose an inch or two off of each side, which is already awfully short.  Fabric is nice and they wash nice, but for the price, I'm disappointed with them. "
Molly,7 months ago,2,"These sheets are a big disappointment. I loved two sets of these sheets I bought several years ago at Costco. The new version is thinner, lacks labels on the sides & top/bottom and don’t stay on the bed. "
Jill,a year ago,5,"I only buy my linens from Costco.  Have always purchased the 100% Pima cotton set, which is amazing as well.  I read reviews for this set, they were on sale, and had to try them.  They are exactly what other reviewers have shared - truly high quality and luxurious!  My only issue (which is my fault for not reading the specifications) is the depth of the fitted sheet.  My mattress, topper, and bed frame make it a little tough to keep them super snug / fit.  My guests will appreciate this oversight - these sheets will be used in our those bedrooms! :)  Another Costco gem discovered! "
JWilliams,a year ago,5,"These sheets are, by far, the best quality sheets I have ever bought. The last sheets I bought at Costco were the Kirkland brand, 540 thread count sateen and I thought they were wonderful. These sheets seem more luxurious and didn't cost over $100. I am very pleased. I even bought a set for the guest bedroom too. I would buy them again, but they will probably last for years. "
Honeysuckle,9 months ago,1,"So excited for these, but washed twice with softener and still scratchy and uncomfortable. They are not soft at all...very disappointed. I'm taking them back. "
KJF_PDF,11 months ago,5,"I ordered these sheets in King Size / Beige.  The color is a true beige and will coordinate with other neutrals.  The fitted sheet is deep enough for today’s thick mattresses. The sheets washed well and looked great after touching up with the iron.  The weave is tight and smooth and there is a slight sheen.  They are soft, but also crisp and thick.  I prefer a crisp sheet over a soft one.  If you are looking for very soft, this sheet may not be for you; I like them.  The price was right for the quality.  I may buy a second set in Beige and then donate my older sheets to charity. "
Terry,10 months ago,1,"I find these sheets to very rough and warm.  I will return them and try another type.  I had read the reviews and some were very good - so I guess everyone has different expectations and likes and dislikes when it comes to sheets - unlike most things. I like smooth, soft cool sheets and these were none of those. "
Mo26,5 months ago,1,"This is the 2nd time I purchased these sheets. The first set was great, high quality soft sheets. There’s a markedly huge difference in the quality of this set. Upon opening the package there was a terrible odor that smelled like vomit. There were lots of loose threads hanging off the pillow cases and they not nearly as soft as the first set,Very disappointing "
Brooke V,10 months ago,4,"The sheets are really great, feel nice, washed up nicely, and more. The problem I have is that they are such a high thread count, I find them to be too hot currently, for July/August. I will pull these out again in the winter and gladly use them then. I think I’ve only gotten 400-600 count, in the past. "
Ernie,3 months ago,1,Did not know the fitted sheets were two California twin sheets our bed is a California King with a single  sheet. 
Carol,a year ago,5,"I really love these sheets, they not only look, feel and wash great but also fit perfectly! I have deep mattress’s and so they are heavy and difficult to pick up, and pull the fitted sheet under it but because these have such a great wide elastic sewing into the corners makes them super easy to fit under. Plus, they stay in place the whole time you were in bed, never sliding out, fit perfect. I’ve bought several sets in different sizes and colors for all of our beds because we love them. "
Anonymous,10 months ago,1,The split king fitted sheets are too loose.  I would like to return 
Darlene Birkland,a year ago,5,These sheets are the absolute best! 
Veronica,a year ago,1,Returned!!! Sheets fell apart first wash!!!! 
Gary,3 months ago,1,Unfinished threads everywhere. 
2beagles,3 months ago,1,seam on top sheet came apart 
The Wild Olive,a year ago,4,"Needed a replacement for my much loved 750 wamsuttas.  These are nice and heavy, but not as soft.  Hopefully, more washings will improve that.  They look nice and are not too wrinkly.  My only complaint is that they are such a tight, heavy weave they sleep hot.  Now that the weather has turned warm, I wake up multiple times a nite overheated (I'm way past that rodeo, so it's the new sheets! haha).  I'll keep them for winter wear, but need something else for the warmer months. "
Whidbey Island,7 months ago,5,"Buy these sheets! Never knew sheets could make a difference in how well you sleep. They are beautiful 800 thread count Egyptian cotton sheets . Not hot weather lightweight crisp percale (which I love during the summer), but comfortable soft, warm sheets. Perfect for colder nights without being flannel. An equally wonderful aspect to these sheets is the top fold of the flat sheet stays flat and not wrinkled so you don’t need to iron in order to have a well make bed. Love that! "
Lauren,a year ago,5,"Soft, thick sheets "
Diane E,5 months ago,5,Beautiful fabric with a silky feel. Thick cotton but sheets dry quickly in the dryer. Permanent press if you do not crowd the sheets in the dryer and you remove them promptly. Good price. Sheets have labels on the sides so you know how to put them on which is important in king size since the two dimensions are close. 
Lindy Lou,10 months ago,5,"I am very pleased with the color (light green) of the Cal King sheets and the fabric.  After washing the sheets, they came out of the dryer with hardly any wrinkles. The length on the flat sheet is very, very nice.  However, the width of the flat, top sheet is very skimpy and we do not have a foam pad or anything else.  My only suggestion would be nice to increase the width of the sheets because when a body is under them at night they just do not cover enough of the body. "
Dina,9 months ago,4,"The sheets are super cozy and not 'slippery"" at all, meaning my quilt stays put and doesn't slide all around.  They are soft and wash very well.  The length of the top sheet is super generous, but the sides aren't quite as long as I thought they would be.  I don't mind it, it just surprised me.  My mattress is a 13"" mattress and the sheet just comes to the bottom of the mattress on both sides.  I bought the blue and they grey and had a tough time deciding which to keep.  Both colors are beautiful.  I ended up keeping the gray but was tempted to keep both.  My husband commented that he likes that the top portion of the flat sheet doesn't buckle or bunch and stayed flat after washing it.  Funny the different things that people like and dislike about sheets.  Never knew that this bothered him with our other sets. lol "
Nuña Bizness,5 months ago,4,"They're on the warmer side for 100% cotton, so they're good for the winter months. They're not as smooth as Egyptian cotton either. Our bed is 14 inches deep and the fitted sheet just barely fits. The flat sheet is on the smaller side also. Overall not a bad set of sheets but not really great either. "
Bella,3 months ago,5,"I first purchased these sheets from Costco a few years ago and was extremely satisfied with the quality & softness. This new set is slightly different from my previous purchase. The material is much stiffer when wet and being removed from the washing machine but after going through the dryer, softens up sufficiently to feel great for sleep. Previous sets feel slightly softer, but I still highly recommend the current set as it’s very soft & luxurious to the touch. "
Pam D,a year ago,1,"There are already flaws in the material that have created small holes in the bottom sheet, small but they can grow so I will have to fix them with my sewing machine. The hem on the top sheet is shedding lose threads that I have had to clip several times now. Disappointing for the price. "
Stephen,2 months ago,2,"Costco is usually very good about supplying high quality, good value products. Unfortunately these sheets began to pull apart at the seems (queen fitted sheet) and fray at the edge seems (queen flat sheet) after 7-8 wash cycles. Of course Costco took them back without any hassle, consistent with its typical high quality customer service. I’m tempted to try these sheets again (first set an anomaly?), but have not yet done so and I’m still on the fence about it. "
Kay O,4 months ago,1,Was so excited to see split king Hotel sheets at Costco.  But as soon as I washed them I was severely disappointed.  I pulled them from the dryer and many places of the seams on the top sheet had began to unravel.  I didn’t even get a chance to use them.  I returned them. 
Anne,a year ago,1,"After 3 washes, I still feel like I am sleeping on fine course sandpaper. I love that the fitted sheet is labeled for sides, is extra roomy and has elastic all around the edges. I will wash a few more times and if the sheets do not soften, I will definitely return. "
David,2 months ago,5,We had bought other Hotel Signature sheets and were very happy with them.  We moved up to a king size bed and needed new sheets.  So we went back to Costco and this brand.  We had to bump up to 800 thread count to get color that my wife wanted.  My only complaint is that they are designed to fit mattresses up to 16 or 18 inches thick.  That leaves a little extra cloth on our mattress.  We just pull it taut and tuck the extra into the foot of the best. 
Sharon,9 months ago,1,"I opened the package excited to have sheets with a 680 thread count, I washed the sheets, and when I put them in the bed, there was a hole on the top sheet, where it appeared the fabric had frayed apart. I couldn’t believe it. I knew the home would only get bigger, so I had to pack them up, and return them. I would have purchased another set, but, Costco was out of the  size. The sheets felt great, but this flaw was just another problem to deal with. "
CyclistsWife,4 months ago,1,I purchased these sheets on-line as I have done a few years back.  There are numerous threads coming off and hanging from top sheet and pillow cases.  Some sections are not even sewed properly.   I'm surprised Costco is selling such a poor product. 
VancK,9 months ago,1,"I pulled this set out and put it on my 14"" mattress. The first thing I noticed was that the depth claims on the corners are definitively exaggerated claims. The fitted sheet just barely covered my 14"" tall mattress.  Next, I unfold the flat sheet and notice there are multiple, large areas with sets bleeched out blots all over the sheet. In addition, multiple stich lines have snags and loose threads. Finally, I have an 800 thread count set I purchased at a discount store which are softer than this set and I paid forty percent of what this set cost on a sale!  I don't want to use this set but we just purchased our mattress and the cheaper, softer set doesn't fit our new mattress height. I also don't think I should have go through the hassle of returning a defective product.  I do not recommend this set...especially for this prjce. "
AbbiesMom,10 months ago,5,"These sheets fit great, have deep pockets, are crisp and thick (I hate a clingy sheet) and feel smooth without being ""shiny"". The packaging smell is REAL and nauseating, but I washed them twice and it went away. I immediately bought another set. "
Heather,4 months ago,5,"Nothing bets cotton sheets.  These are so luxurious. I love them.  Thick sheets because of the high thread could, but they breath really well.  I never feel hot in them.  I will definately buy another set in the near future and would recommend. "
Kathy,4 months ago,2,Disappointed.the material is soft but has  terrible workmanship. Loose threads and incomplete seams. I needed to replace my sets and bought two of these bed sets due to the ratings. I am returning both. I would not recommend these sheets. 
Shellshell,4 months ago,1,"Not the best, the seam lines all had extra strands of fabric. Also one of the pillow stitching is already coming undone. The color was not true biege, its a weird grey color. The texture is also very heavy. Overall I would not recommend. "
Al A,6 months ago,5,Split Cal King sheets are hard to find.  These are my second set and hold up well (5 years) and this set seems even better.  They wash really well and  wrinkle free.  Not  paper thin like many cheaper sheets.  Comes with 4 pillow cases. 
wayner638,2 months ago,5,"These are a heavy, but soft sheet. Just like you'd get staying at a nice hotel. They stay on the mattress perfectly due to the solid band of elastic and the extra elastic at the corners. I've bought these for all the beds in our home. "
Bill Busch,a year ago,5,"These sheets are just wonderful!! The quality is superb, the fabric feels thick, not skimpy like other brands I’ve tried. The 100% cotton feels so good. They fit perfectly on my Cal King bed, and the price can’t be beat. Washes well. "
vernatude,a year ago,1,"The quality of this particular batch of material that makes up the bottom sheet is very poor, as I have one visable hole and more that appear to be developing. The top sheet has discoloration and loose threads around th perimeter. "
dj522,10 months ago,3,I expected that an 800 thread count would mean that these sheets would be very soft to the touch. I was disappointed to find that they were not as soft as the last sheet set I purchased which had a lower thread count. 
Maria,8 months ago,1,I was really hoping to love these sheets. I have 2 friends that love them. They were very uncomfortable to me. Almost like a shiney slippery feel to them. I bought 2 sets. Ill be returning the other one I didnt open. 
Lady Di,8 months ago,4,"The sheets fit really well and stay put!!! They are good quality but are a little stiff. I wish they were a little softer on the skin. As these are King size sheets, I love that it tells me which is the side vs the top/bottom of the fitted sheet!   The seam's threads are coming out although the seam is still OK. I'm still hoping with continued washing that they will become softer and less stiff. Otherwise, they are what I expected from Costco.  I wonder if I'd have taken the less costly ones with lower TC if they would have been perfect for what I needed. "
rkirk,9 months ago,1,First set had a tear in the top sheet and on the second set the side seam was frayed the length of the top sheet. Both were returned to Costco with no problems. We purchased new sheets from a different vendor. 
Michelle,5 months ago,3,Not very soft.  after washing themand the firstt night of sleeping was rough. Got a little softer after4 nights. The only plus is extra pillow cases. I love the kirkland brand but doesn't come in split king. 
Melmo,4 months ago,3,These were very nice sheet but not sure how durable they are because they got a tear in just a few days of use. I have some from home goods that are very similar and have used for months with no issues 
Disappointed,a year ago,3,I bought these sheets 2.5 years ago and they have just now torn straight down the middle of the fitted sheet. We haven’t done anything out of the ordinary with these. Just washed them about every other week. They are super soft though and we have enjoyed sleeping on them. Very bummed they have torn. I have other sheets that we’ve used for longer that haven’t ripped. Now I just have to decide it it’s worth the $80 for another set for 2 years… 
Jennmo,5 months ago,5,"Love these sheets.  They are not ordinary sheets you buy online.  Quality , heavyweight but so comfortable.  My husband and I both agree these are the best sheets since 40 years of marriage "
kbj01,4 months ago,1,"I bought two sets of these sheets.  Within 3 months, a hole wore through the bottom fitted sheet on BOTH of the sets.  I have never see a sheet wear so poorly, let alone one that was $110. "
Terri,6 months ago,5,"The bottom sheet fits well, but not too tightly, on my deep mattress and tags tell you how to position the sheet without guessing.  I wish the top sheet was a little longer and wider because it would stay tucked better (but not really a big deal). Nice feel. They don’t sound crunchy. They wash well without wrinkles. Pillow cases aren’t too tight.  WAY better than my last hotel sheets from Macy’s that shredded after a few years. "
Disappointed customer,a year ago,1,The top sheet stitching was frayed the entire length on one side. I will have to either return or restitch the entire side to keep the side hem from opening up causing more fraying. 
wego,4 months ago,3,"The color is nice and the sheets seem well made.  However, they are not nearly as soft as I expected for such a high thread count.  I'm hoping they will soften with more washes. "
Tracy B,5 months ago,3,"These sheets are supposed to be 800 thread count but they feel more like cheap imitation. Sorry, but they just don’t seem like quality to me. Several loose threads on them too. "
Not smooth enough,3 months ago,3,These sheets are thick and luxurious but not soft/smooth enough to the touch for me. I returned them and went to a store where I could do the touch test and bought another set. 
HPLA,4 months ago,1,"The sides are already fraying. Owned it for Wen washing however, it is a very comfortable sheet love the weight of it just don’t understand why it’s all already fraying. "
Mandie,5 months ago,5,We’ve had our new sheets for a couple of months now and they are comfortable and stay on the bed well. The deep elastic corners on the bottom sheet are a real bonus! 
Eherin,5 months ago,1,I had such high hopes for these sheets.  I have had several sets from Costco over the years and I was quite a fan!!  I decided to order these and pay more for them after this high thread count was not available in store.  Just received them.  Hey actually have dozens of tears in them along the top edge!!!  Looks like they were chewed up by a machine!  Apparently there was no quality control in place.  Very disappointed! 
Mario,a year ago,3,"I bought the 800 thread count sheets because they were on sale and the 680 sheets are my favorite sheets ever and I thought these would be even nicer. In fact, I would rather have the 680 Kirkland sheets. These had many loose threads and almost seemed frayed at the seams. Also they don’t stay on as well as I had expected. Thery are fine, but if I had it to do over I would buy the 680 Kirkland sheets- best sheets ever. "
Southwest Rancher,a year ago,5,"This is a top of the line item with a very fine texture due to the high thread count. A such they are very comfortable sheets. I purchased the king set that includes a fitted bottom sheet, top sheet and 4 king pillow covers. They have been washed several times with no shrinkage. Since I have been getting little more than months of longevity from 400 and 500 thread count sheets, I am hopeful these will last longer. As usual, Costco free shipping and reasonable delivery time, and particularly good quality for a good price, make this a great purchase. "
Betty T,a year ago,5,"These sheets are wonderful.  100 percent cotton, elastic all the way around and labels for top and bottom.  They wash up beautifully and are so smooth! "
Chuck,11 months ago,3,"Oddly thick, heavy sheets. Had a bad smell when unwrapped, which thankfully went away upon washing. We don’t regret the purchase, but won’t repeat it "
MommieDearest,2 months ago,3,"We've slept on these sheets through several washings now. I like a high thread count, but these seem to just be thick cotton sheets without the softness. They arent horrible or anything, I just wish that for the price, they were softer. I miss the Charisma sheets that Costco used to sell. Positives: thick, fitted sheet is actually big enough to fit mattress, not too terribly wrinkly out of wash.Negatives: not soft enough, flat sheet isnt big enough to tuck in both sides (why dont any sheets do this?!), might be too thick for summertime sleeping. "
Volvogirl,a year ago,1,"i must return it because it arrived with the stitching very messed up, not where it should be, so falling apart when new out of the package. "
Swamy,a year ago,1,Fitted sheet came soiled with oil like stains that we did not notice till we put it on after washing it first. It is in multiple places. 
David,a year ago,1,"After only a few weeks of use, and a couple of washings the sheets are getting a pilled texture.  Also the fitted sheet is quite loose. "
Linda,a year ago,1,"They are soft, and wash well. Howver after only being laundeted 4 or 5 times, the top sheet hem is raveling. I plan to return them. "
Renny2011,6 months ago,5,Love these sheets!  I have purchased more expensive sheets but none better.  These stay snugly fit on even extra thick mattresses.  So they are nice and flat and smooth always.  One small thing that is a huge help on California king size sheets is the tags on the sides that tell you which ends are the sides so you don’t have to try them several times to figure it out.  Why didn’t someone think of that sooner? 
Maj229,a year ago,5,If you don’t own these sheets you should. Best sheets on the market for the price. Very comfortable sheets to sleep in. 
SLOsww,4 months ago,1,Sheets were an absolute mess of loose threads and poor construction. I didn't realize this until I had washed them. 
Teri,11 months ago,2,"Sheets are heavy but also stiff and rough, not at all soft and silky as the thread count suggests. Disappointed! "
ValueShopper230,10 months ago,5,"My original set was bought a year ago, and has gone through many wash/dry cycles.  The The blue color is almost identical to the new set I just purchased.  They remain comfortable.  I find the tabs that indicate 'top' or 'side' to be very helpful.  I also like the elastic sew into the corner seams that make the sheets easy to pull over my mattress.  Best sets of sheets I've ever owned.  Very pleased. "
JA in NC,a year ago,1,The top sheet in both my sets of sheets has come apart at the seam.  I will return them asap. 
Dalatlyne,a year ago,4,A little expensive but great quality. I will certainly buy another set in a different color. 
Louis,2 months ago,1,Loose threads coming apart on the seams. Very disappointing for sheets at that price. 
Gretchen,4 months ago,1,Rough and itchy even after washing in baking powder and vinegar. Returning asap 
Katk,a year ago,5,"The sheets are soft, easy to care for and fit nicely on our king size bed. "
Great sleep,a year ago,5,"Sheets are fabulous, luxurious feeling!!! Well made and quality fabric "
Weekend golfer,6 months ago,5,Great sheets and warm too. Fits really good on my thick mattress. 
CaliforniaKitty,25 days ago,5,"I purchased these sheets about 4 years ago in the warehouse. I got lucky enough to get them on sale. When I wanted to get a few other back-up sets, I couldn't find them in the warehouse or online. One of my king bottom sheets has developed a hole from the dryer latch, so I wanted to see if they were available again. I was so happy to find them online. They cost a bit more than when I purchased them in the warehouse, but I don't mind that given how much I love these sheets. They are soft, thick enough to use as a light blanket in the summer months, and durable. We only have the two sets of sheets so they have been washed a lot over the past 4 years. I love the deep pockets and the tags that tell you which is up and which is the side. That is especially helpful on at King and California King set of sheets. These sheets are awesome. You won't regret your purchase and they will last for years. "
Vanessa S,a year ago,5,This is my second set of these sheets. I LOVE these sheets!!! 
Bill,4 months ago,1,Fitted sheet did not even come close to fitting the mattress. 
Rebma,9 months ago,1,"I bought these sheets to replace my prior set of the exact same sheets. I washed them, made my bed, and couldn't wait for a great night of sleep. I jumped into bed and was accosted by the scratchiest, roughest set of sheets I have EVER owned. I don't know what they changed about them, but these are most definitely not the same sheets I bought last time, and they don't feel anything like an 800 thread count cotton sheet should feel. I've always paid extra money for good sheets and thought this was a good deal since my last set was so nice, but I can't wait to rip these off my bed and burn then. Unfortunately I can't return them because I threw away the wrapping. Thankfully I kept the old set and will go back to using those.  I should also note that I bought the white sheets. My daughter has the gray ones and they're completely different from the white, not a consistent product. Do not buy. "
LCLR,11 months ago,4,Nice quality sheets. However very heavy & hot sleeping. 
Annette,a year ago,1,Sheets have shrunk. Soon I will not be able to use 
Brad,6 months ago,5,Really nice. Not super soft but very well made 
Char,5 months ago,4,Very deep sheets so run big on the sides 
Do not recommend,3 months ago,1,Sheets came with all seems unraveling. 
Brent,a year ago,5,Good heavy sheets and well made 
TML1982,3 months ago,4,"Purchased these and they are pretty stiff to begin but I washed them twice and can see where they will 'get softer' but the edges of the top sheet are horribly finished.  Strands of unfinished cotton sticking out of it all over the place. I feel like most of these will wash out over time, but the 'look' is diminished by this.  Not a good final product look but still a good product. "
MBWillson,a year ago,5,They fit & look great. 
Nancy,9 months ago,1,Smells disgusting 
Betty,4 months ago,3,"The sheets feel nice and the fabric is substantial. But the sewing is poor. There were many hanging loose threads that were not properly trimmed. Also, usually with a pillow case the open end is folded and sewn after the side seams are sewn for a clean opening, but with these the side seams are sewn after the folded trim which leads to a very sloppy (and I think cheap) look to the pillow case. So originally I thought getting four pillow cases in the queen set was a plus but due to the quality of the sewing I don't like the pillowcases! "
Susan21,9 months ago,1,"I bought these sheets 3 months ago and used them in rotation with 2 other sets of sheets. At first I liked them even though they were not soft; I thought that would improve.  It didn't, they were noisy, and very hot.  Could not get comfortable with them.  I wanted to like them, but couldn't.  I returned them and bought the 680 count sheets at the warehouse.  They are much nicer. "
Maggz,a year ago,5,Luxurious 
diane,5 months ago,2,Bring back the Kirkland Sateen Sheets.  I tried the Kirkland Brand that I have purchased for years and now this Hotel one.  They are not the same. 
SalmonFilet44,4 months ago,5,"The sheets are soft, and they get softer after washing. They have some heft to them, so they feel high quality. They are large enough to support thick mattresses but I get a tight fit for the fitted sheet on my 10-inch mattress. I ordered the beige color but it is extremely dull, almost grey. They have tags on the fitted sheets that denote top/bottom and side. "
Dianne,4 months ago,2,When I saw that these sheets were on sale I knew I had to buy them. I’ve purchased and enjoyed Costco 680 thread count for many years. These 800 thread count felt wonderfully soft when I opened them. I washed them and noticed all the edges were unraveling. Also there were flaws running through the pillowcases. I will go back to the 680 thread count sheets! 
Eddyhawk,3 months ago,3,"We have now washed the sheets 4 times and used three times after initial wash when new. Likes - great elastic around all sides on fitted sheet; sides and end labeled; ample materialDislikes - very thick which means they do not drape around you; they rustle when you move, roll over etc (they are loud) In other words great quality but not not for us. "
Dogster,10 months ago,4,"High quality 100% cotton sheets.  The Queen size top sheet is HUGE.  The Queen size fitted sheet accommodates thick mattresses up to 15"".  But it you have a thinner mattress like my 12"" one, the sheet fits pretty loosely.  After washing & drying, the sheets wrinkle a lot since they're 100% cotton.  Overall, still a great value for high quality sheets. "
Micgl,2 months ago,1,"I don't know what happened with the quality of this set, I got many in the past few years. The last ones were a deception for this price point and I won't buy them anymore. My last try was last week, took forever to ship and right after I took of from the package there was two big rip on the cover sheet. I also feel they're not so soft as in the past. "
Anonymous,a year ago,2,"The sheets feel great, even after 5-6 washings.  However, we found about a 2 inch hole, does not appear to be a “rip” type hole just below the top edge, and near the side on the top sheet. No idea how it occurred in that spot. Especially since it does not appear to be rip, just a hole.  We sewed it up as best we could and continue to use the sheets. "
ACJMB,4 months ago,2,These were a replacement for an identical product purchased a couple of years ago. The first one had creases in the top sheet that could not be ironed or laundered out. The second one frayed along the side seam after the first laundering. Still waiting to see if it progresses after the second washing. Will probably return it if that's the case. 
PGJLG,10 months ago,5,Love these sheets! Have had a hard time finding a set for a split king. Usually buy separates (fitted/flat/pillow case) and it ends up costing a lot more. The quality is not as nice as this set and nothing matches.  Enjoying finally having matching sheets! I bought 2 sets of these and would buy them again.  Great fit on our split mattress too! 
Lela Kay,10 months ago,5,I have been purchasing these sheets for many years and you cannot beat the quality.  They are soft and crisp at the same time.  But the best part is that they are long enough to tuck under the mattress far enough to keep them from pulling out.  The bonus pillow cases are also a very nice bonus.  You will not be disappointed in these sheets. 
Auto,5 months ago,5,I bought these sheets years ago and fell in love. I went back to Costco during the pandemic and they were no longer there. I purchased what they had in stock and those were awful. No idea why they took these out of the store. I didn’t think to look online until someone suggested it. These are seriously the best sheets I have ever purchased. 
Woodside,4 months ago,5,"Excellent, thick-but-very-fine cotton sheets that are smooth and breathable and have an extra-long Calif. King top sheet and sturdy elastic corners on bottom sheet. The stitching all around is well done.  We have a set of the Hotel Signature 600 Thread Count sheets, which are very fine, also, and have gotten softer and more pliable, while retaining their shape, over many washings.  I assume this 800 Thread Count set will be similar and very long-lasting. Simply put, the sheet set is beautiful, comfortable, and top quality. "
Strick,a year ago,5,"Bought these about 4 yrs ago and I loved them so much that I didn’t put anything else on my mattress.  I’d wash, dry them, and have them back on my bed the same night.  I’ve tried other brands but these are the best.  I came back to buy two more set’s because after weekly washings and 4 yrs later I ripped a whole in the fitted sheet.  Now I have another good set and one backup… just in case Costco stops selling them.  Please don’t!! They are a deep fit.  Pillow top mattress with a pillow top topper and still a great fit. "
Dana,9 months ago,5,"These sheets are probably the best sheets I have ever purchased.  I have purchased Pottery Barn sheets that were $300 and these are honestly better. Buttery soft, and just feel amazing when you slip into bed. We have a California king and the sheet pockets are plenty deep and they stay in place. I would highly recommend these sheets. "
zapvive,a year ago,5,"I purchased two sets of the Hotel Signature 800.  They feel thick and sturdy, but yet sleeping on them is a great.  They fit the bed snuggly but are easy to put on as the pockets are extra deep.  The bottom stays taught and has never bunched up in the middle of the bed like some thinner sheets do.  I am very happy with my purchase. "
PDSS,11 months ago,2,I was very excited to receive my new sheets. They did not meet my expectation. They were rough against my skin and very warm to sleep on. For the price I was expecting more. The best thing about these sheets was the tag disguising the top/bottom from the sides on the fitted sheet. Thank goodness for Costcos amazing return policy. 
Txaggiemom,9 months ago,5,"I bought these sheets 2 months ago for my split king adjustable bed.  Finding sheets to fit this bed that will actually stay on when it is adjusted has been hard.  These sheets are generous enough to be tucked in and stay in place.  The length of the top sheet is also longer than most; therefore, it stays tucked in at end  when bed is adjusted.  The moving the bed up and down is now great with proper fitting sheets.   After a couple of washings, these sheets are so soft.  They wash great.    I like the sheet set enough that I bought a second set.    I have paid a lot more money for sheets for the split king, only to be so disappointed in the fit.  Those expensive sheets have now been replaced with this great set of well fitting quality sheets.  You can't go wrong . "
Happy Costco Shopper,4 months ago,1,The sheets had a strong chemical odor when I opened them. I did some research and found out that most wrinkle-free or wrinkle resistant sheets are “finished” with a chemical process to keep them from wrinkling. That chemical process generally includes the use of formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is predominantly used as an embalming fluid — as a way to preserve something. I decided I didn’t want to take the chance sleeping on chemical dosed sheets and returned them. 
kimS,10 months ago,3,The sheets are a beautiful blue/green color.  Love the color.  They washed and fit nicely.  They are scratchy and I guess that is because they are only 800 count.  I am hoping with additional wash cycles and time they will feel nicer.  I think the ones I purchased that are a little less expensive feel better and fit the same 
Anonymous,10 months ago,2,Have two other sets of these sheets for other beds and the new set are not the same quality as the other two. These wrinkle quite a bit both with being dried and sleeping on them.  Thinking the material used for this new set is within the “standard’ of the production but not quite as high a grade.  Disappointed in this set. 
Dixie,5 months ago,1,I bought these sheets for a Christmas present for my daughter.  I washed the sheets and was ironing them.  During ironing I found that the seams were not sown together and already coming apart.  If you pay $100 for a set of sheets I expect them to be better than that.  Will be taking back to Costco!  Very disappointed. 
Terry z,5 months ago,5,"Best sheets yet! I’ve spent/wasted so much money on bad sheets, but not these. I have a 18” mattress, these fit great! They are cool feeling, and don’t come out of the dryer all wrinkly. A bit pricey for me but so worth it. I only wish they offered more colors and/or a pattern. I will be buying another set for sure! "
Elnorm,11 months ago,1,"The sheets have a horrible, headache inducing chemical smell before being washed. They have been washed/dried  and the odor seems to be gone. Costco used to be my “go to” for great merchandise for a better price. This is no longer the case. My membership has gone to lowest level, and may not renew. "
LE reviews,a year ago,4,I’ve been ordering these sheets for years and love them. They feel marvelous. But this set’s color isn’t as pretty as my other older sets. Beige used to be a warm tan color. The new set is a greyed beige which I find odd. It doesn’t match nearly as nicely as my older sets. But I’m keeping them because of the feel. 
Peter,7 months ago,5,"These are the best sheets I've bought in a long time. This last set is for the guest bedroom because my 2 year old sheets (same type) are still in great condition. They have not shrunk, torn or come apart and still look like new. I highly recommend these to anyone willing to spend a little more for real quality. "
Darla,8 months ago,5,"I personally like crisp sheets which this one is not.  However, these feel very luxurious, smooth, and substantial.  Only time will tell how well they withstand wear and tear through use and washings.  Bought these in September.  They aren't too warm for end of summer weather and feel like they should be very comfortable for the cold winter months coming up.  The price was also very good.  (Didn't trust buying other cheaper ones on line!  And found some twice+ the price of these.)  I will probably buy a second set. "
Gail,3 months ago,5,"Heavy weight, smooth cotton.  Love the deep pockets and elastic all the way around on contour sheets and generous length and width on flat sheet.  They fit our 12 inch matress with ample overhang for tuck in. We got the blue, which is more of a Seafoam color, true to website photo.  Would definitely buy again. "
Allie,4 months ago,4,"I would have given these a 5 star except for the fact that the sewing on the pillow cases and having to trim frayed material coming out of the stitching on some areas on the flat sheet. One pillow case wasn’t lined up to match the seam at the opening cuff and has a folded seam that will always be there. Another one wasn’t properly laid flat when sewn together and it wants to roll at the cuff of the pillow case. Too much trouble to take back. Would be wonderful if I could only exchange two pillow cases. But the sheets are luxurious, soft and feel so good. I have actually ordered another set and have not opened them yet to check the pillow  cases nor have I washed them to see if there will be any threading coming out that needs to be trimmed off. These are my go to sheets. "
Leslie11,3 months ago,5,"These are FANTASTIC!  If you have ever stayed at a Penninsula Hotel, or other high end 5* hotel, this is what these sheets feel like.  They are thick, stiffer than the 680's and just really super nice.  If you want buttery softness, these are not those.  If you want a luxury sheet - these are a steal! "
Wyatt J,a year ago,1,"I bought two sets of sheets. Both are supposed to come with four pillow cases, a flat sheet and a fitted sheet. One set came with three pillow cases while the other set only had two pillow cases. The sheets are very stiff, even after washing. They are okay as far as sheets go, but not soft to the touch. "
Yoggi,4 months ago,2,"Received my sheets and I was going to wash them before putting them on my bed. I noticed some loose thread. Then, I saw it was just not one little spot but, the entire set of sheets. Something must have been off with the machine, not foot quality control. I returned them with no questions. Thanks Costco "
Cesar T,6 months ago,5,"I was worried when they started out pretty rough. Just wash them once. They feel great. We purchased a second set. I’m surprised but worth the extra price. Only a few washings in, no comment on durability, but Costco usually stands behind their products so I’m not worried. Still, a sale would be nice. "
hobie82884,4 months ago,1,"I bought these sheets a month ago and have washed them 4 or 5 times and still can't stand to sleep on them because because they are so scratchy. I tried soaking them in cold water with salt, Cold water with baking soda, Vinegar, And as a last resort even used fabric softener. I will be returning them. "
Virginia,4 months ago,2,I have a set I bought about 12 years ago and love them.  This set I just purchased was way too satin feeling and when I washed them prior to putting on the bed all the seams had threads coming out.  I tried to trim off the pieces of threads (there were more than a few)!!!  I put them on my bed and they were not tight at the corners!!!  They kept coming loose!  The threads in the seams were like shredding!  The sheets felt very hot to sleep on!  I washed them again and the threads were like the sheets were coming apart!  I returned them and replaced them with the 680 Kirkland brand which seems to be better made!!!  Totally disappointed but the only thing I can think is that Costco changed manufacturers with the “hotel 800 count” sheets!!!  I will never purchase these again! 
Ron B,5 months ago,1,The sheets feel nice and look nice but they do not stay tucked in . The corners of the fitted sheet needs an elastic band in each corner to ensure the sheet stays tucked taught and flat . Unfortunately these sheets always come loose and bunch up under you while sleeping . We are disappointed .. 😔 
N Doyle,2 months ago,5,"I purchased some Costco 680 thread count sheets over a year ago for a guest bedroom. They were generously cut and had no issues fitting a new Costco Novaform mattress.  They had a nice crisp feel and the hems were beautifully finished.  So why were the brand name premium sheets on my own bed so baggy and ill-fitting?  I ordered Costco's Hotel Signature 800 t.c. and am so pleased that I did.  The sheet on a king mattress fit so nicely, with ""clues"" sewn to the hems so it was put on in the right direction; plenty of fabric on the top sheet to give a good tuck under the foot of the mattress to not be kicking the sheet off during the night.  The soft dull blue color was more than perfect, not a babyish blue but a bit more muted and cosmopolitan.  Fabric was tightly woven with a smooth luxurious feel and had the same quality production features as the less expensive 680 thread count product.  I am so very please that I now have these sheets on my own bed!  Thanks Costco for the qualith and pricing! "
Marylou,a year ago,4,"Love the vibrant colors (white and gray as I like to alternate colors between the bottom sheet and the to sheet), the strength of sheets, only a few wrinkles coming out of the dryer, and that they’re 100% cotton. They are soft, but wish they were even softer. Great sheets for a fair price! "
Border Collie Mom,7 months ago,5,"These are lovely sheets.  Was worried when we first got them that they might be too warm as they seem a little thicker or heavier than other sheets....but that is just the quality in them, I suppose.  They are cool and comfortable to sleep on, are very well made, and are great sheets. "
Noelie,5 months ago,4,"These are crisp and cool and feel of great quality. They feel Cooler then the molecule sheets in my opinion as I bought both. Returned the molecule sheets as my husband and I both thought they ran hot. The hotel sheets, I can move around and areas unoccupied, cool off quickly. "
MT Chicago,5 months ago,5,Features that I look for are included with this single package purchase. Bought for a family member as a gift. The color selections are beautiful and sophisticated. The second set of pillow covers are a welcome plus. Packaged quite nicely and the fabric has a pretty sheen. 
Tacanno,9 months ago,4,They are nice beefy linens and they feel really good on your skin at night. I was disappointed in the cheaply sewn hems that had all sorts of threads hanging. I expected better seams for that amount of money. I didn’t send them back. Hoping they don’t continue to unravel. 
Jo D,10 months ago,5,"They definitely do not make good quality sheets anymore, it seems covid changed the world and companies are using cheaper material and charging more. Not with these sheets, the quality is excellent and they are nice and thick, not thin like most sheets they make today. "
Suzmarh,a year ago,5,"This is my fourth purchase of these sheets over a few years time, we recently purchase a new mattress that required a split king set. I purchased two sets. I don’t think there is any deterioration in the current product compared to the products I purchased in the past "
Susan,a month ago,5,Amazing! I really didn't believe for the price these sheets would feel thick and soft and wonderful.  But they do.  They are beautiful sheets that you would pay $300+ anywhere else.  I couldn't be more pleased and immediately bought another set for our guest bedroom. 
tmartini,4 months ago,1,Poor quality! These lasted a mere six months before prematurely wearing a large hole that tore in the bottom sheet. Very thin material. I will say they were soft and the color was nice while they lasted. I will be returning these and looking for a better quality set. 
tswright,8 months ago,4,"I like the feel of the sheets, and how the corners of the fitted sheet are designed to keep it in place.  I also like that the fitted sheet has labels to tell which side you're working with.  I will buy this set again.  The only nit-pick I have is that the flat sheet could be wider by 4"" to 6""; my mattress depth is 11"" and the flat sheet barely reaches the bottom of the mattress on both sides so there's no way to tuck the sheet if you want to do that.  I typically like being able to tuck the flat sheet. "
PJP55,5 months ago,4,"Purchased a set of these a few years back and love them. These, although advertised as the same, are not of same quality. These ones have threads hanging from the seams and the feel is quite different. With that said, I do still like these sheets versus most others. "
jspot,11 months ago,5,"These are by far the best sheets I have ever owned.  They are not light or satiny smooth, they just feel sturdy and sooo comfortable.  These are for the guest room however my wife and I have been sleeping on identical sheets for 4 yrs and they show no signs of wear. "
Montana ranch girl,9 months ago,1,The blue set had 6 machine made vertical slits in the middle of the sheet evenly spaced apart. Took the set back to Costco for a refund. Really wanted these sheets but it appears someone wasn't doing a very good job at quality control before the set was packaged. 
Tropics Tuti,6 months ago,5,I purchased a Cal king split sheet set. Although it took a while to come in it was worth waiting for it. The sheets are crisp and has a perfect fit. You know you’re sleeping in luxury.  I’ve washed them and they look good as ever.  I feel I be a good investment. 
SharBear2,2 months ago,1,"I was really looking forward to getting these sheets. I opened the package so I could wash them before putting them on our bed. They are so poorly made! The seams have threads everywhere. For the price, I really expected better quality. These will be going back! "
Sand5547,9 months ago,4,"The texture of these sheets is very smooth and silky.  They aren’t totally wrinkle free but come out of the dryer with much fewer wrinkles than any cotton sheets I’ve had in the past.  I’ve noticed some threads are coming undone on one of the hems on the flat sheet already.  The fitted sheet holds well.  The pillowcases were quite long for my king pillows, about 5 inches excess.  Overall a nice, comfortable sheet set for an okay price considering its a king set, with four pillow cases rather than two. "
Evan,4 months ago,1,"When I received my sheets, there was an odd stain on the outer bag.  I ignored that and immediately saw a big snag before I could even get the sheets all the way out.  They also seemed like they would be itchy.  I'm returning them so I guess I'll never know. "
Picky shopper,10 months ago,5,"Nice quality sheets….thick cotton, and have labels on the sides to tell you which is top and bottom and sides. Fit well over my California King bed and have deep pockets enough for thick pillow-top mattress. Would DEFINITELY purchase again. No complaints "
john,6 months ago,5,"These are the best sheets I have ever purchased.  I tried to find them in the warehouse but couldn't .  Lucky to find them on Costco.com.   They are soft, easy to wash and very comfortable.  Plus they offer a split king which is what I need.  Excellent "
Steph,4 months ago,1,I purchased 3 sets and will be returning all of them. The quality is very bad. It seems as if the machine got stuck while stitching. Also there were holes in the top sheets when they had never been used before. Do not waste your money on these sheets. 
jsaus63304,4 months ago,2,"I have been using the Kirkland 680 thread count and thought this would be an upgrade.  Nope.  After washing, they had loose threads all around the top sheet and there were flaws in the sheet.  I will be returning and buying the Kirkland sheets again. "
Michelle,a month ago,5,"I bought 3 sets of these sheets several years ago and I was highly impressed. I just ordered 2 new setsonline. They are incredibly soft and durable, wash after wash. The best sheets at a amazing price.I received $20 off each set I ordered on line. "
Costco costs,a year ago,1,800 thread count where is the rest of my threads? my 680 thread count Kirkland brand bedsheets are more comfortable and better quality. I recommend those before I buy these again. 
Susan,a year ago,3,"They are a nice color (the gray) and look good.  Seem very well made and I like the little tags on the fitted sheet telling you if it's the side or the bottom.  However, their main negative is a big one - they are not that soft.  I'm surprised considering the thread count, etc. but they are, if anything slightly rough - they are the least soft sheets I own, despite having the highest thread count.  I am hopeful that the softness will improve with additional washings.  They've only been washed once. "
MDL7,3 months ago,1,"I bought 2 split king sheet sets to accommodate our new split king bed.  Our mattresses are 16-17"" deep.  These sheets state they are for 16"" mattresses but they DO NOT cover the mattresses.  I am so disappointed. I am going to return both sets. "
CDarling,2 months ago,4,"The sheets do what I bought them for. They grip your mattress and don’t slide. I wish it was a higher thread count so they would be softer and permanent press. They come out of the dryer, wrinkled as heck when I buy them again? Yes they do work. "
Mary,8 months ago,1,"The package had a very sour smell to the contents.  Like it was wet when boxed.  I washed them with Tide detergent and the smell did go away.  However, the sheets and pillow cases were huge/oversized.  I ended up returning them dissatisfied. "
Nancy,6 months ago,5,"These Hotel Signature 800 Thread Count cotton sheets are the most comfortable, beautiful sheets I've ever had. They are silky smooth to lie on, and have a luxurious beefiness to them. And they launder beautifully. Absolutely worth the price. "
T im,5 months ago,5,Love my new sheets.  They have extra deep pockets that fit easily over the mattress.  The top sheet is long enough to tuck in firmly and still fold over the top blankets.  The pillow cases are huge.  The set washes well and doesn’t wrinkle. 
Disappointed,11 months ago,1,Couldn't return because hoped washing would help.  Never used because knew i wouldn't sleep. 
Sandy,2 months ago,5,I love these sheets. They stay tucked in. They have elastic on all the sides. The corners have elastic so everything fits really tight. All the sides are labeled with “side” and “top or bottom” which makes it really easy to put them on. 
Thomas,a year ago,5,"These sheets compare very favorably to my favorite Damask sheets that I buy from a large national department store for a lot more money. Soft, silky finish using thick cotton material. Plus you get 4 pillow cases. I will be buying more! "
Charley,a year ago,5,"We've had these about a month now, and they're luxurious and comfortable. I admit I had second thoughts about my wife's choice of grey. I thought I'd prefer a colorful color. But the grey is dark enough to speak of elegance. I like it! "
suziq,8 months ago,5,"I keep coming back to these sheets. For the money you can't get better. They are heavy weight yet soft, so they last through many washings. Probably the only sheets I liked better cost three times as much so obvious choice with these. "
PeteInNoCAL,8 months ago,5,"We've used several brands of high-end cotton sheets over the years. We previously purchased ""Hotel"" brand sheets from a major department store (at a much higher price than these), and, while satisfied, they were rather expensive. Although the thread count of these sheets are slightly lower (600 instead of 800), they are every bit as comfortable and seem to be of excellent quality. (We'll see for sure after 50+ washings...) All in all, we'er quite satisfied and are likely to purchase these again. "
Elizabeth,11 months ago,5,"I am very satisfied with these sheets and pillow cases.  In fact, I have purchased them before.  They are of good quality and are very soft.  If you are fussy, as I am, you may need to iron them after they come out of the dryer. "
Peacekeeper13,5 months ago,5,"Best sheets I have ever used. Even better than the Kirkland Signature 680 Thread Count sheets we used to have. The sheets are not thin at all, feel great against bare skin, and make me not want to get out of bed in the mornings. "
MemaB,10 months ago,5,"If I could give these sheets a ten, I would. They are luxurious and do not wrinkle. I recommended these sheets to my Facebook friends. Thanks to my daughter’s designer’s recommendation, I now have sheets I’ve always wished for. "
Susan,a year ago,5,"I LOVE these sheets! They feel so good on the skin and they wash beautifully. Very good quality. These are my fourth sets of Hotel Signature 800 Count Cotton 6-Piece Sheet Set. I would buy more, but I don't have storage room. "
CostcoDevotee1,4 months ago,5,"Much better quality than sheets I've purchased elsewhere.  I have been using a set for over a year and they still look great.  Seams are holding together well, so my recent purchase was a second set to have on hand as needed. "
Teresa,4 months ago,4,Price is right but definitely not first quality. The material is wonderful but the hems have quite a few stray threads that detract from the quality. Scissors needed to trim all the way around the flat sheet & pillow cases. 
Bob B,9 months ago,1,"For what we paid for these, was not expecting issues.  All 4 pillow cases had strange runs on both sides.  Also, the entire package smelled like death and it transferred to everything they touched.  Will not be reordering. "
Molson,6 months ago,5,"Buy them again and again. As I replace worn out sheets in our home, I turn to these fabulous comfortable but crisp sheets. Guest also love them and comment on them. And since we live near Key West, we get a lot of visitors "
CBlackman,2 months ago,5,I loved these sheets so much I ordered a second set.  They are generous heavy high quality sheets that will last a long time.  They wrap all the way around the mattress and the elastic on the corners holds them in place. 
Lele,10 months ago,5,"Thick, soft, comfortable, the best sheets I’ve slept on. There was a weird smell when they were new but it was gone after I washed them. I have another set which I bought a year ago and they still are in good shape. "
LWinona,a year ago,3,"I wanted these to be like the old Costco sheets that were so silky soft, but, alas, after five washes, they are still pretty scratchy. I am not using the pillowcase covers for that reason, the sheets are tolerable. "
Naty,9 months ago,1,"Bought thinking it was the same quality as years ago .. nope! Sewing coming out, sticker with “defective” marking some stains (package was sealed so no open/return case) .. very disappointed. Returning for refund. "
Yin1,5 months ago,1,"The fitted sheet came with several parts that were frayed, maybe from friction? So it looks like it'll tear soon. The flat sheet has numerous fraying on the edges. Very poor quality control for a $100+ sheet set. "
Sco1,4 months ago,5,These sheet are considerably thicker than the Wamsutta sheets we used to buy before BB&B went bankrupt. They need a few washing to soften up but so far so good. The fitted sheet is much tighter with more elastic. 
Flash,4 months ago,1,"I purchased these sheets, washed them and they are rough to the touch.  Especially the pillowcases.  For this amount of money for 800-count sheets, I expect a soft smooth feel.   I am not happy with these sheets. "
HiFi Man,6 months ago,3,"Nice feeling sheets, very high quality. But the fitted sheet pockets are much too deep for my new and very costly 12"" Tempur-Pedic split king mattresses and it's not possible to get even a slightly tight fit. "
T Prescott,4 months ago,1,This was our second set ordered within a few weeks and after the initial wash threads came apart at multiple seams.  Bummer as we were impressed with the first order but unfortunately won’t be ordering again. 
CatMom,9 months ago,5,I really like these sheets.  I have a California King with a mattress topper and they fit with plenty of room to spare.  Plus I like the fact that they state which side is the top or bottom. Would buy again. 
Rockly,10 months ago,4,"The fabric is very nice but there were some flaws in the manufacturing and even a couple of tiny holes in one of the pillowcases along with some poor seam sewing.  Overall comfortable and wash well, though. "
Sage,a month ago,4,Love these sheets! Beautiful and soft. My only complaint is there are way too many loose threads that look messy when you first open the sheets. I’m hoping they don’t pull any further and unravel over time. 
Hospitality manager,6 months ago,5,"Most comfortable high quality sheets.  Worth the money!  I put them on the bed damp and they look and feel ironed.  After traveling quite a long time, I was so thankful to sleep between these luxury sheets. "
LizE,2 months ago,3,Love the softness of these sheets but after washing them once the edges started to unravel so I had to take them back. I will try another set to see if the same thing happens or if this was just a defect. 
Uhoh123,a year ago,5,"Except for the fact that our mattress isn't very thick and the fitted sheet needs a lot of tucking in to work, the sheets are very nice. They come out of the dryer looking good, and they're very soft. "
DC24,a month ago,3,Was disappointed in the finished quality.  Inside seams of the pillow cases and sheets had sloppy unfinished raw edges.  I needed to trim loose threads and the seam binding looked rushed and sloppy. 
In Need of Massage,8 months ago,4,"These are actually very good quality sheets. They’re a little thicker than I’m used to, which makes them come off a bit stiff or starchy feeling. But I think with a few washes they’ll be wonderful. I will say the packaging and delivery wasn’t great. At some point after I ordered them I received an email saying they were delayed but they didn’t have any idea when they’d be shipped. And when they did finally arrive they smelled so bad. Even the box they came in stunk. That was concerning. "
Nancy,a year ago,5,"I am probably one of the most picky people when it comes to bedding. My sheets have to be of good quality, feel and lasting. These sheets are strong and comfortable and the flat sheet is extra long. What that means is..if you have someone who turns and toss and constantly pulls on the blanket, you will still have coverage. Yay! I was glad the sale came back. I bought these sheets for all the beds in the house. Believe me when I say I've tried all brands. These are absolutely my favorite. "
MauiSnicks,a year ago,3,Love the fit and feel but really disappointed by how quickly the fabric became “pilled” with lots of little flannel pills all over. Really hoped their quality would have been better - disappointing 
LMAUG,4 months ago,1,Wanted to love these sheets but they are too rough. I washed them as instructed but after sleeping on them I itched all night and my skin had a rash in the morning where my skin touched the sheets. 
Edmond D,a year ago,5,Very nice sheets. I was surprised that the king set came with 4 pillow cases because the website only list 2 which was an added bonus as we needed 4. The sheets are very comfortable and well made. 
Linda,6 months ago,5,Beautiful feel to touch of the sheets.  They don’t seem to fit quite as tight as my last king size fit.  My only complaint was the price which seems out of proportion to the regular king we have. 
Sherry,4 months ago,5,"The 800 Thread Count Cotton Sheets are quite lovely!  The fabric is thick and soft, and wrinkles seem to slide out.  They feel quite luxurious.  Definitely a winner, especially at a sale price! "
Jerry,10 months ago,1,I ordered California King sheets The package said California King However the sheets do not fitThe bottom fitted sheet just barely fits the mattress The top sheet barely covers the mattress 
Dan G,a year ago,5,"The best quality and feel that I ever experienced in sheets.  I normally don't notice the difference in thread counts, pima cotton vs other cottons, ect.  The Costco sheets are just the best! "
owner,a year ago,3,These sheets are good for a flat bed but not so much if you have an adjustable bed. Corners of sheets have a difficult time staying attached to the bed when you're in an upright position. 
Ruby T,a year ago,5,"I love these sheets. They’re very soft and have a nice heavier weight so they don’t wad up. Great price, too. Note: they barely fit our 16” mattress. They wouldn’t fit an 18” as labeled. "
Mommyshark,5 months ago,1,The sheets had a vinegar smell to them and the seam where they are sown together had a lot of loose snarled threads and bunched up fabric. They don't seem very soft or of high quality. 
Hope D,9 months ago,5,These sheets washed up beautifully and are very comfortable to sleep on. The dark blue color is perfect. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a great product at a great price. 
Ginger,a year ago,5,"I cannot recommend the Hotel Signature 800 Thread Count Cotton 6-Piece Sheet Set enough. These sheets are the epitome of luxury and quality. Sleeping on them is like being whisked away to a high-end resort, enveloping you in the ultimate comfort and softness. The fitted sheets are clearly labeled with the top and bottom, making bed-making an effortless task. If you're looking for the ultimate in bedding, look no further than this sheet set. A truly indulgent and satisfying experience. "
Snowdogs,9 months ago,1,Washed these sheets once and two seems on the flat sheet is frayed . Also the cal king flat sheet is barely wide enough to cover the bed. The sheets are rough and itchy. Returning. 
Ruth,3 months ago,3,"The sheen on the sheets is intense.  Hopefully it will diminish with a few washes.  The stitching along the perimeters could have been better.  However, the actual material is lovely "
Mitzi1122,9 months ago,1,After the initial wash and dry of the sheet set I went to make my bed and noticed that the top sheet seem was not falling apart. So frustrating considering the cost of these sheets. 
Denise B,10 months ago,5,"The hand on these is very luxurious.  They wash and dry perfectly, just be sure to read the instructions as they differ from many other sheet sets.  They’re a dream to sleep on. "
YaYa,4 months ago,4,"I bought a set of these a while back.  They were wonderful and so my daughter bought a set too.  The second set I bought weren't good.  The sheet was over a foot shorter than the first one and the top was totally wrinkled.  I had to iron and starch it.  My daughter's second set frayed, wore out  and didn't last long.  Looks like we both ended up with  a very bad batch.  If these sheets are like the first set I will be very happy.  If they are like the second batch, they will go back. "
Richard,10 months ago,5,"These are some of the highest quality, soft, heavy sheets I've ever used. In fact, that's all I use on all the beds in my house and both my 5th wheels. They’re really comfortable! "
Gigi,4 months ago,1,"I’m sorry to say these sheets feel like sand paper next to my skin.. I’ve tried the 800 count Kirkland Brand and they are wonderful, I was mistaken thinking these were the same. "
Emelor,a year ago,5,Love the great quality cotton fabric. This is the only bedsheets I buy 800 thread hotel brand. I wait for the sale price since it’s so expensive but last long and feels good. 
Susan,6 months ago,5,The texture of these sheets is fabulous! They seem a bit larger than other sheets I've purchased from Costco. I plan to order another pair we are so pleased with this set. 
Bill,4 months ago,5,These sheets are wonderful!  Someone finally came up with the great idea of labeling each side of the fitted sheet to take the guesswork out of fitting it on the mattress. 
Nick,a year ago,5,"Great sheets !  We like that there are tags indicating the positioning for the fitted sheet— front, bottom & sideAlso they have that crisp feel and extremely comfortable "
Tara,11 months ago,3,"We love these sheets they are cool and comfortable, the only issue we noticed is we are started to get small holes/tears in the sheets and we have only washed them once. "
Amy H,4 months ago,4,I love the feel of the sheets. I’m not sure of how well they will hold up. The first time I washed them one of the seems unraveled for about 10 inches on the flat sheet. 
TH68,9 months ago,5,"I've bought these for years but on this order the sheets had a foul smell which luckily went away after washing with Downey Unstoppable.Otherwise, great quality sheets "
Jade4,9 months ago,3,"It says it's made of cotton which I really enjoy and appreciate! However, it has a strong smell when opening one of the two packages I ordered (beige color). The same strong smell for the other one. A small issue is that the pillow size (I bought the King Split) was extremely long, which is way too big for my King size pillow. I can deal with this but thought it is a waste of material for my case. The product was made in India. I can't comment on quality as I just start to use it. "
Alan,9 months ago,1,This is not comparable to other brands in the same price range. I rather pay a few more dollars and get a nice set that feels soft but at the same time is durable. 
kkGSO,7 months ago,3,"Nice crisp fabric that launders well. Generously sized pillowcases.  Fitted sheet minimally tailored and cheaply hemmed, remains baggy on an extra deep mattress. "
Kevin S,3 months ago,5,Glad I bought 2 sets of these to go with the mattresses. The Thread count is higher than the ones offered at the store. The feel is luxurious and worth the cost. 
ann c,3 months ago,2,not as good as the old Charisma sheets that Costco used to carry.  But I needed Split King and this was the only option.  they are fraying already. and not soft. 
Nick,10 months ago,2,Not worth the money. They are scratchy. Not soft. Not COOL. One pillow case had a stain on it. I hope I can return even though I washed it. Huge disappointment. 
Sheet connoisseur,a year ago,2,"Our original set of Hotel 800 sheets, purchased over ten years ago, finally had to be replaced. So we ordered what we thought were the exact same set. We were very disappointed with the new ones. They have an identical tag as the old set but feel nothing alike. Whereas the originals were crisp, silky and smooth, the new ones are rougher and do not have that cool-to-the-touch feeling. Unfortunately there's no way to get the original formula so we're stuck with these. Buyer beware. "
adelegrec,2 months ago,3,Just ok sheets . Darker colors any facial oils stain them . Would have returned comply but good price for split king. Noticed older queen size fraying a little 
Hot Carl,a year ago,5,These are THE best sheets. They are so soft and cool and the pockets are deep enough for two mattress pads.  I get a new pair every year when they’re on sale. 
David,4 months ago,1,The sheets smelled weird at first but this went away after washing.  But then I realized that the fitted sheet was the wrong size.  Had to return everything. 
bargainshopper1000,a year ago,1,Terrible! These ripped on corner after one use. Not the same quality as the sheets I had previously. Same brand and thread count. Sheets not as smooth. 
Mike,11 months ago,5,"Best sheets ever!!! These queen size sheets are super soft and durable. These sheets fit large mattresses well and the sides, top, and bottom are labeled. "
DDD_Costco,a year ago,5,The product is superb.  My wife and I love it.  Well made.  Competitive price.  Silky smooth … soft to the touch.  We definitely sleep better … Thank you. 
Marlene K,a year ago,5,Very high quality sheets. They feel far more dense than my old set of sheets. Soft sheen to the look. Nice deep elastic corners. Very pleased with them. 
C Kelly,a year ago,3,Sheets came with strong odor that was gone after washing. What wasn’t gone after several washes was the rough scratchy feel. Can not use this product. 
jse034,a year ago,3,This is the third set of sheets I have bought from Costco. I have one gray set and have bought two sets of the blue. The gray sheets are my favorite as they fit my Queen size mattress perfectly. The odd thing about my sheet purchased are the blue ones. Neither set fit my mattress very well. Both are too big. Not hugely too big but too big enough to not fit snugly without sloppy wrinkling. 
James,3 months ago,5,Wonderfully soft & crisp sheets. The weight is perfect & love the color (kind of a slate dark blue). Used them for about 2 months and so far so good. 
DonH,10 months ago,3,"The sheets were OK, but a little course. For an 800 thread count we were expecting a bit softer deep. They are well made and should last a long time. "
Sheetsbuyer,a year ago,3,It’s decent for the price but not as soft as I would have liked. Bamboo options with lower thread count are softer. 
ocean307,9 months ago,1,washed them per the instructions........then we notice the seam was frawed on the non-fitted sheet.  what a disappointment.  need to send them back 
Carol,a year ago,5,"Best sheets EVER! I have three sets and truly love the feel of the sheets, corners are very well made on fitted sheet and they wash up wonderfully. "
Anonymous,10 months ago,5,One of the best things about these sheets is that the top hem doesn’t wrinkle much. They launder very nicely. Came out of the dryer looking great. 
Sandy M,9 months ago,5,These are great sheets that fit well and have a nice feel to them. Been using for a month and they have washed well and are holding up nicely 
Mermaid,a year ago,5,I’ve bought these sheets in the past for gifts. I decided it was time to treat myself. They wash beautifully and are so wonder to sleep on! 
Robnrobt,9 months ago,5,The material is of high quality and feel comparable or better than those of Macy’s Hotel Collection brand.  I will buy again.  Great value. 
Kate,4 months ago,1,Washed as directed before first use. Stitching started to unravel in several places especially on the pillowcases and the flat sheet. 
POCraig,11 months ago,5,"They are awesome sheets.  Although they feel thick, they are very cool to sleep on.  Material is soft and feels good against your skin. "
mamabear08,3 months ago,5,Love the feel of these sheets they wash up beautifully and have two sets oh pillow cases. Even my husband mentioned how nice they were 
Sandy,8 months ago,5,"I absolutely love these sheets. Il love the fit, love the feel, love how the fitted sheet is marked  with a tag sides and top/bottom. "
Maria,a year ago,3,"For the price that these sheets cost, I expected them to be softer. I bought them on sale or else I probably would’ve returned them. "
Pineapple Lemonade,5 months ago,3,We have a king pillow top sterns and foster mattress. The fitted sheet does not stay on over night. The Costco sheets are 2” deeper. 
Malissa P,2 months ago,5,"Soft, thick, soft and comfortable sheets. True bright white and I love how the sides and top/bottom are labeled for easy bed making "
Sister,a year ago,5,These are great. Soft after washing. Elastic all around. Tag to identify side edge. Perfect. And at a good price for this quality. 
Jody H,a year ago,5,"The 800 count keeps warm in the winter and cool in the summer. We have a split CalKing.  The fitted sheets fit perfectly and never come off. The flat sheet is extra large and fits longer and wider than most sheets so there is never a problem with fighting for the top sheet. Split CalKing's are hard to find, so when I found these on sale last year, I bought a set. They are not cheap, I waited a year for them to go on sale so I could buy another set.  I highly recommend them. "
Tami M,10 months ago,2,I like the sheets very much however after two washings there is a quarter size hole in the top sheet which is very disappointing! 
LOUMAN,a year ago,5,Sheets are very high quality with near-satin finish.  Seams and edges are nicely finished.  Fit on my California King is perfect. 
Candles,5 months ago,3,I prefer the fabric of the Kirkland signature 680 thread count.These sheets are a little heavy and beckon for frequent washing. 
Rick G,4 months ago,2,"The sheets have many loose threads all around the edges. Very poor construction quality, we’re surprised Costco even sells them. "
Denise,a year ago,3,Love these sheets! Only 3 stars because now they cost way more than the first time I bought them and they wear out really fast. 
Rjsnow,9 months ago,5,"I have been looking for sheets for quite awhile. I purchased several other brands, like Cozy Earth and returned them because they weren’t soft enough and felt itchy. These Costco sheets so far are great, soft and 99% itch free.  I thought I would have to iron them but they are very wrinkle free.  I also like the weight of the fabric. It’s not flimsy at all, feels high quality. These sheets are keepers!  The price also makes me happy, very affordable and I got them on sale. "
Sariana,a year ago,5,They are soft and thick but not warm. Pure luxury. Bought two sets and donated my old sheets to an animal shelter. Buy them. 
R Timmons,a year ago,5,This is my second set and I am thrilled with the quality and durability. Nice deep pockets and sides and bottoms are marked. 
SohlCo,10 months ago,5,Luxurious sheets! These are very silky and comfortable - such a silly thing but we love the labels for top/bottom and side. 
Kathy,a year ago,5,Pockes on fitted sheets are generous making it easy to make bed.  Nice fabric.  Sides and ends are marked on fitted sheets 
AtlGal,a year ago,5,Love these sheets. Don’t need ironing if you remove from dryer immediately after they are done. So crisp to snuggle into. 
Susan,a year ago,1,I ordered blue and I got something that looks greyNow I have to go to the trouble of returning them Very inconvenient 
Wife of user,10 months ago,5,These sheets are a dream. They wash well don’t wrinkle and have a lovely hand. In addition they fit my thick mattress! 
Al Burns,6 months ago,5,Sheets feel great and are soft enough and fit king size bed adequately. Would highly recommend you give one set a try. 
Martista,2 months ago,3,"I do not have a problem with the quality of the sheets, I am not happy that they are not the color that I ordered. "
Jackie27,10 months ago,5,"great product! Thick, soft, smooth. Would love to also see your Kirkland brand sateen sheets come back. Miss them. "
Dave,9 months ago,4,We bought these sheets once before and were pleased with the quality. But I can only give this review 4 out of 5 stars because when my wife opened them up they had a really strong chemical odor to them. It was very strong and concerning. So she decided to wash them separately and thank goodness the odor disappeared. We never use anything like sheets or clothes or towels without first washing them but we wondered if we would have to return them if the odor didn’t go away. 
Evagab,10 months ago,5,Great look & feel.  Almost wrinkle-free. The light sheen of the fabric makes it feel soft & cool.  Will buy more. 
Dk23,6 months ago,5,Great set of sheets. Soft 100% cotton and washes well. Not wrinkled when it gets out of the dryer. Great quality! 
Dolores,9 months ago,5,"First fitted sheet I don't have to struggle with to get on my mattress.  It's deep enough to fit my 15"" mattress. "
David,a year ago,5,Excellent sheet set.  Fits very well.  Does not grab you in the middle of the night.  Comfortable to sleep under. 
Murph,9 months ago,4,I love the sheets. my only beef is that the bottom sheet is not a tight fit. Other than that they are wonderful. 
Kathy K,3 months ago,5,These sheets are plenty big and shrink resistance. Plus 800 count is very soft. A little pricey but I love them 
Kirkland Product Fan,4 months ago,1,Returned sheets as they were very rough & uncomfortable to sleep on.Made it difficult to ger a restful sleep 
Anne,a year ago,5,"Bought it when discounted at Costco. Love these sheets, great quality and expecting a good many years of use. "
Jana,a year ago,5,So soft!  Wonderful to sleep on and after washing they are just as soft as ever.  Like sleeping on a cloud!!! 
Mike,a year ago,3,"Bought two sets on sale and generally happy with the sheets.  But after first laundering, right out of the package, I noticed that one pillowcase had a half-inch cut in the fabric.  This didn't become obvious until the location frayed a bit in the laundering.  Clearly a Quality Inspection oversight in the Manufacturing. I probably could have returned, but in my case wasn't worth the waste of time as I had two sets (= seven other pillowcases).  Disappointing nonetheless. "
Jack,11 months ago,5,These cost more than the ones I had been using. I really like these. I'll never use the cheepo sheets again. 
NJ08054,a year ago,5,These sheets are comfortable and luxurious. This is the third time I’ve bought them. I would recommend them. 
Seba mom,a year ago,3,The sheets were WAY too hot. They also weren't nearly as soft as I would have thought for 800 thread count. 
Anonymous,9 months ago,5,Nice deep pockets for new thicker mattress. Split Cal King size not available everywhere but Costco has it! 
AngelC,4 months ago,5,Great quality and love how the fitted sheet has a tag for you to know if it's the top or bottom of the bed. 
Judy,9 months ago,1,"THESE SHEETS ARE ROUGH AND I CAN NOT SLEEP ON THEM, I WILL RETURN THEM TO COSTCO.  THEY MAKE MY SKIN ITCH. "
Limey,10 months ago,5,"Finally happy to find bedsheets that feel like cotton . They’re thicker,softer than most. Better quality. "
Wanda2020,3 months ago,5,Great fit and feel. These sheets are comfortable and after washing feel even softer. I would buy again. 
Paty,10 months ago,5,Very nice and soft. great product. Its a pity they do not have duvet covers the same brand and quality. 
Susan,9 months ago,1,Smelled like the sheets had been bathed in chemicals. Way too much to wash out. Returned to local store 
Pat K,a month ago,5,"Fine, cool fabric, very comfortable and not heavyweight. Have always enjoyed the Kirkland cotton sheets. This line is a bit more luxurious to the touch and silky feel. Thrilled to find the split king option which has not before been offered by Costco. This is comparable in quality to luxury brands which don’t offer four pillowcases AND cost a $100+ more. The fitted corners are also the best available anywhere. We have a split king adjustable bed and they stay in place! "
Costco shopper,a year ago,1,"Returned them. While they had nice wide elastic pockets, they were thin and rough, for the price. "
Costco customer,4 months ago,1,"I washed them before use, and noticed fraying at seams, very disappointed. It will go back to Costco. "
Liana,5 months ago,5,"My new sheet cover completely covers the bottom of the mattress. No more slipping. Yeah, thank you ❤️ "
Barry,6 months ago,5,"good quality, I like the feel.... used to replace 1200 thread count sheets that wrinkled excessively "
spurjp,3 months ago,5,"Nice material, washed well, no smell or issues.  The sheets feel nice and seem to be a good value. "
Doris,a year ago,5,"These sheets are great. The fitted sheet is deep so it fits nicely on a large and high mattress - no more trying to lift a mattress corner to somehow get a very fitted  sheet on and breaking your back! Also, the sides are labeled. Seems silly but when you are trying to put a fitted sheet on quickly, it’s nice not to have to guess. The sheets feel very luxurious, wash and dry nicely, and seem of high quality. I will definitely buy these again and highly recommend them. "
Pariscup,4 months ago,4,"I like the sheets, but they’re slightly bigger than my mattress other than that I’m very pleased. "
Bridge View,a year ago,5,Nice quality sheets with 4 oversized pillow cases (extra long) Worth the $$. I would buy again. 
Ashley L,10 months ago,5,Love the quality and as you wash they seemed to hold and get better! Soft and doesn't trap heat

Jeanyes,9 months ago,1,Horrible odor + poor stitching at seams + pulled fabric in center of sheet = returned! 
KrisAdventures,2 months ago,5,"These sheets are the highest quality, most beautiful sheets I have ever had the pleasure to see or sleep on! They are so thick, I feel certain that they will last forever. They are generously sized. I love the labels on the fitted sheet, making it easy to determine the ends and sides. The elastic on the corners makes it easier to put on the mattress. The sheen on the silver is so gorgeous, they make me feel like a movie star getting into bed. I absolutely LOVE them! "
Star,9 months ago,5,"Beautiful, silky smooth sheets.  Pretty much wrinkle free, wish they had more colors! "
Anonymous,a year ago,5,These are the best quality and so soft.  They last forever I have bought them before.

Pauline,11 months ago,5,So soft and durable with a satin feel! I've bought them for everyone in the family!

Name,4 months ago,1,"Disappointed, I had to return them. I wish they would check before shipping them. "
Caffeine Diva,4 months ago,4,"I'd give it 5 stars except that the side hems weren't stitched closed leaving the exposed raw edge of the fabric unraveling.  I'd read other reviews saying the same thing but took a chance on the two sets of sheets I ordered in Janiuary 2024.  Only one set had the problem and only on the flat sheet.  I had houseguests with a new bed and new sheets, had to use them regardless.  A little embarrassing.  Otherwise the sheets lay nice, drape beautifully, feel luxurious. "
Diana,a year ago,5,I love these sheets. Very well made. They are soft and silky feeling on my skin. 
Jbcal,a year ago,3,"nice color, and thicker cotton but not as soft as should be at 800 thread count "

Lrga,4 months ago,3,"I ordered 2 sets. The blue was fine but the grey had several snags in the fabric. I turned the first set and they shipped a new one. The second set also had several snags in the fabric and the stitching was very poorly done. Returned the second set. Not sure why one color was fine and the other was damaged. The one that we kept is soft and seems like it will likely last many years. Overall, I would not buy again because it seems like the quality is hit or miss. "
George,6 months ago,5,We were very pleased with the quality and fit of these sheets.

Gs williams,9 months ago,5,Excellent have washed 3 times. Still great I bought 2 sets 
Insomnia,9 months ago,2,"Barely opened package at one corner and discovered sheets were a weird, sharp, seemingly-synthetic fabric. Maybe it's a sateen, but whatever it is, it's not the comfy, premium pima cotton I hoped for.    The Costco 680 Signature sheets are silky AND soft -- and less expensive too.    I might be hypersensitive but I can't imagine sleeping on this sharp, slick fabric. Maybe it would soften if laundered and the sizing chemicals washed out, but I'll never know because i returned it unopened.    All that aside, I can't imagine buying sheets/blankets/pillows/mattress pads anywhere but Costco. This is one category of merchandise that compels us to maintain our membership since the original Price Club days. Love that Costco guarantees your satisfaction so you don't get stuck with awful bed linens. You can't go wrong with Costco! "
Bucky89,a month ago,5,We have an expensive air bed and have standardized our household sheets on these 800 thread count sheets from Costco.  They have an excellent feel to the touch and great fit which is important because we have a flexible base that can raise or lower the head or foot of your bed to achieve a zero gravity position.  Thusfar we have had no issue with the fitted sheet giving way in the changes of attitude. I don't think for the price you can find any better product. 
Ellestar44,a year ago,5,I own 3 sets! They are the best sheets I have ever owned.

NANCY Brightwell,a year ago,5,The best sheets  love them.  Why only on line? 
Pam S,9 months ago,4,"These sheets are thick and luxurious, I’ll give them that. But if you’re the kind of sleeper who likes “quiet” sheets these aren’t for you. While they feel nice against the skin, they unfortunately make a crinkly noise with every movement. I’ve only washed them once, so I’m hoping that several washes, along with fabric softener, may make the material softer and less likely to wake us up every time we turn over. But I still gave them a four rating for quality. "
Legan,3 months ago,3,"I'm so torn on these sheets. They are comfortable and soft, but also poorly put together. None of the seams line up on the pillowcases, and all the the threads at the seam are loose. Plus there's a cut in the middle of the fitted sheet. It doesn't go all the way through the fabric but was there when I opened up the package. Also, they are very wrinkled out of the dryer, even though I follow the directions exactly, and even dry each of the sheets on their own. "
Jimbo,a year ago,3,"I ordered the Hotel Signature 800 Thread Count Cotton 6-Piece Sheet Set, King, White and received them four days later. The seam on one side of the flat sheet was unraveling so they were returned for another set of the same. These came in with a significant sized hole in the flat sheet. I've been trying to get a return authorization for these for several days. Currently waiting for my UPS return label as they would not take these in return at my local Costco. "

Rita,a year ago,5,Love the way they feel 
Beth,3 months ago,4,"Ordered California king bed sheets. The sheets are short in length. I measured them and they are eight inches too short as advertised. That makes a huge difference as they cannot be tucked in at the bottom, or go up far enough if you try to tuck them in. They are also quite heavy kind of cardboard like. I've washed them four times since getting them, and they are still stiff and cardboard like. I'm keeping them, even though they are not exactly as stated. "

Secret Shopper,4 months ago,5,Soft and smooth 
Patti,3 months ago,5,"Love the weight quality, the feel the sheen the size and the way the fitted sheets fit … they even have top bottom right left written because so often a king fitted sheet looks the same on all sides and it’s so helpful to have those little letters printed on the sheets when you’re making the bed!  Price was a little high, but still less than the extremely high-quality sheets, and when I buy anything less expensive they are thin, and you immediately know. "

yana,9 months ago,5,These are hotel quality sheet sets. The best sheets I have found anywhere. Last through many washings and always look great. Quality outstanding. Deep pockets. Seams are solid. One set I have used for 5-6 years and still beautiful. Hold their shape. No pop up on corners. My sheets are California King. When I shop for sheets I always purchase Costco. Just wish they were in our Costco so I wouldn't have to order them. I have 2 extra sets in each bedroom . 
Compucart Tray,5 months ago,3,"I always buy the Kirkland brand of sheets that are around the same price as these. Thinking that the 800 thread count would be just as good as the Kirkland brand, I purchased them. They feel more like a 400 thread count. They are rough sheets. The only reason why I purchase these is because of the color and Kirkland does not offer a dark gray. If you're not worried about color, stick with Kirkland. I think you would even save $10 off of this sale price. "
angp,a year ago,5,Sheets 
Yaojiu,6 months ago,5,Great 
Yolie,a year ago,4,"I have owned the Hotel 800 thread sheets for many years and have been my absolute favorite.  Recently I ordered another set and washed as recommended.  The top (mostly) and the bottom seam were not sewn properly and it they frayed quite a bit.  Sheets were returned and I ordered another set in a different color and I had the same issue.  As I mentioned, these are my favorite sheets so I will wait a while to purchase again until this issue is resolved. "
Sheet Guy,a year ago,2,Poor manufacturing quality. Stitching was messy with seems not finished well. Numerous loose threads. Not much confidence in durability. Decent fabric but not matching expected quality of 800 thread count or higher price. Thread count results in heavier weight sheets but they are not any softer. Seems lower quality than Kirkland 680 thread count sheets but at a higher price. I returned this product and stuck with the Kirkland 680 thread count sheets. 
Sandra,a year ago,1,"After inspecting the sheets, found small hole about the size of a quarter near top hem in the middle of the upper sheet.  Also, the stitching had threads that needed to be  clipped.  It became obvious that quality control was lacking at the factory.  I expected more from sheets this expensive. "
marycontrary,a year ago,1,"I’m happy with the sheets, they are awesome, but whoever picked them chose gray when I’d ordered beige. I phoned customer service, although helpful, they said I’d have to mail the grey sheets back in order to receive the beige color I’d ordered. I’ve already washed and placed these sheets on my bed, am unwilling to return. My caveat is to check the color you receive before deciding to wash. "
Not deep pocket,4 months ago,2,"I bought the Queen set in Beige. The fabric is smooth, has a great feel, and is wrinkle free. However, the description says it fits “up to 18 inch mattress”, which is complete hogwash. I selected these specifically for those deep pockets  — and the fitted sheet isn’t’ even deep enough to fit on my 12 inch mattress! So it’s forever popping off, all saggy and baggy. Extremely infuriating. I washed them before using, so now I guess I’m stuck with them "
pickygirl,9 months ago,5,Nice Comfortable Bedding. I read some reviews about the sheets being rough but I haven’t had issue with the softness. These sheets are generously sized and fit my mattress well with it me having to struggle to put on the fitted sheet. The fitted sheet is labeled on the bottom and sides for ease of use. These are not thin sheets so they should last pretty well. They are 100% cotton so I wash them in cold water and dry them on low to avoid shrinkage. 
DesertQueen,4 months ago,5,"These sheets are everything I hoped for. Great weight material, superb manufacturing, fit the bed correctly and most of all ....they're so soft! They do need to be washed first. They have a slight smell from manufacturing but that completely disappears after the 1st wash. I took the sheets out of the dryer as soon as they were dry and no wrinkles at all. I purchased white so I can't attest to the colorfast of these sheets. But overall, A+ from me. "
Maddie,11 months ago,5,"Love these sheets.  They feel wonderful to sleep on and launder beautifully.  Since the pockets are deep in the bottom sheet, it is easy to fit on the mattress.  Costco's price was really a savings.  This thread count would have cost much more from department stores or other online.  You can trust Costco to be advertising the truth about the products they sell.  The king set was not in our store so we ordered it from Costco's online...super easy. "
caitengl,9 months ago,5,"Thick, sturdy, long lasting. I love them and I dread when I can't find them anymore. These are not soft brushed, plastic-y microfiber or wrinkle free silky percale. These are SHEETS. I want to call them crisp but that's not the right word, they are too heavy for crisp. When I put these on the bed, no matter if I machine dry or line dry (preferred) when my husband and I get into bed be both sigh and say ""these are the best sheets ever"". I use keep one set of sheets at a time and wash and put them on in one day so I don't have to fold or store sheets. I used my first set every night for 3-4 years and my husband's gross toenails finally ripped a hole in the bottom sheet. I just ordered my second set. I know I'm running out of time. I should probably stock up and buy a dozen sets so we never run out. I buy the white ones so I can bleach them. "
Gladiator,7 months ago,5,"My favorite sheets! There's noting like cotton to keep you cool.  I replaced my old microfiber sheets with these and and I am happy I did.  Everything about them is quality.  Has a tab at the top and bottom that says ""Top or Bottom"". Stops you from putting them on the wrong way which I used to sometimes do with my old sheets.  Elastic around the four corners is extra wide and thick and they stay in place.  Extra deep to accommodate a thick mattress. 800 thread count is great and feels soft and cool on your skin.  My granddaughter spent the night and she loved sleeping in my bed. She kept rubbing her face on the pillowcase saying how good it felt.  I would buy these again in a different color so I can have two sets. I bought gray which looks gray and not silver which I consider to be light gray.  Everything about these sheets are excellent! "
petcat,a year ago,1,i have always bought kirkland sheets 800 i have a king bed and need 17 inch drop on fitted well these were like 21 inch didnt fit tight at all and not 800 i thought 680 i have on queen was thicker 
JandR,a year ago,5,"Thicker than most sheet material, smooth, soft and comfortable.  Returned many sheets to other stores that stated on the lable a high thread count, yet they felt like sandpaper.  These are  better quality.  Love the elastic and printing saying side or head/foot.  Makes it easier to make the bed.  King size was plenty big for my king sized matress with additional topper. Fingers crossed they last. Sheets seem to be a major investment any more! "
Frtchdog,4 months ago,5,"The local Costco warehouse on Maui did not have California King sized sheets so I looked them up on Costco online.  These hotel sheets far exceed the quality of the warehouse sheets (which I like and have purchased in the past).  They come out of the dryer wrinkle-free and soft.  The 800 thread count assures that I won't wear through them like bamboo sheets.  A bit more expensive, but far less expensive than the online bed linen companies. "
MelM,4 months ago,5,The first night we slept on these sheets my husband commented on how much he liked them. I totally agree. Their thread count makes them smooth yet there's texture there too. They fit well over our 15 inch mattress although the I would have liked the flat sheet to be a little wider. We were delighted to find that the insides of the fitted sheet had tags with Top/Bottom ad Sides on them taking the guesswork out of putting it on. Big plus!! 
MayV,5 months ago,5,"These are lovely. The fabric is substantial but soft and not bulky. We appreciate that there's a tiny tag on each side hem of the fitted sheet that says ""SIDE"" so you don't have to figure out the correct orientation of the sheet when putting it on the bed. The overall size is generous and accommodates a deep mattress. They don't shrink in the wash! We bought two sets so we can always have one available when the other is in the laundry. "
NC Grubb,4 months ago,3,"It's a shame for as nice s these sheets are there are so many loose threads you have to trim off when you receive them.  They are from edge of sheets where material is under fold but apparently sheets weren't properly cut/trimmed before finishing edges.  We're assuming trimming is sufficient and there may be a few that come back but edges appear to be properly done. So disappointing but so far still very nice, substantial sheets. "
DeeDee,7 months ago,4,"I waited for these sheets because they are always on back order with the size I needed. I'm a little disappointed because with an 800 thread count cotton I thought they'd be softer. For the money, they are nice but I think pure 100% Egyptian cotton or 100% Pima cotton are much softer. I think these are sateen. My skin is sensitive and I can tell the difference. I think I was hoping because of the 800 Thread Count,  they'd be softer. "
Dogsmom,a month ago,3,"I purchased 2 sets of these sheets and returned one of them after using the first set. The wrong color was shipped for the second set, but that wasn’t a deal breaker - I could have lived with the color that was sent. The primary reason for the return is threefold: there were MANY loose threads everywhere there was a seam, the fabric was heavier than I like my sheets to be, and they came out of the dryer a wrinkled mess. Not for me! "
DeborahinLA,2 months ago,3,"I was expecting really fine well-made sheets but the set I received had what seemed to be an unfinished edge on the top sheet. Plus the sheets were heavy, didn't quite stay on my admittedly deep mattress, and weren't particularly soft. They washed well--minor stains came right out--though they were pretty wrinkled. There was something luxurious about them, but after I returned the first set, I decided not to buy a replacement set. "
Margaret B,a year ago,1,"I ordered an 800 count queen sheet set and after waiting almost 2 weeks, it arrived with four king size pillowcases, so I returned it. A lot of. "
Barbara H,a year ago,5,"These are the best sheets I have had in a long time. They almost have a satin feel. I have a very deep pillow top mattress with  3 inch foam on top and these sheets have deep corner pockets and fit well over it all and can still be tucked under on the sides. The top sheet is extra large and is great. As long as you either put them on the bed or fold them immediately after taking out of the dryer, they are basically wrinkle free. "
Deborah  K,4 months ago,2,I purchased these sheets online and hoped for the best. The dark blue color is very nice. They had a sheen appearance until I washed them before going on the bed. I dry my sheets separately to stop them from balling up in the dryer and when I pulled the top sheet out it was terribly wrinkled! They needed to be ironed! The sheen look was now dull and they don't feel soft. The edges are terribly finished and the fraying is awful. 
Vermont Sleeper,7 months ago,2,I got a set of these sheets in white from the store about a month or two ago.  They are lovely.  They do remind me of hotel sheets.  They are thick but silky.  They are big enough for a thick mattress.  Then I ordered from Costco online.  They sent me a weird khaki color instead of white.  I don't particularly like the color but don't want to go through the hassle of returning the sheets.  The quality still seems to be good. 
Susan,8 months ago,5,These sheets are really nice and they are 100%cotton. It's hard to find any 800 tc or higher that are not blended. I've been searching for a long time. They'll only get softer after each washing.  Well made! Fits over the mattress perfectly. The best thing ever is that the fitted sheets are labeled side and top/bottom. No more struggling to put them in the right place. I love them! I'll be back for more! Highly recommend! 
snakeriverrat,9 months ago,5,"Several years ago, I purchased these sateen sheets.  They soon became my favorite as they were comfortable and cool during the summertime.  I recently discovered they were available on Costco On-line and they were on sale!  I ordered another set.  They have replaced a much more expensive set of sheets and I will now alternate between the two pair I have of the Hotel 800.  The original set has ""matured"" exceptionally well. "
KayKay,2 months ago,5,"I have bought several sets of sheets from Costco over the years and really have not had any issues. I bought a set of dark blue, 680 T/C and liked them but after a few washings you could see different shades of blue. I decided to try the 800 T/C because they were on sale. I ordered dark blue but received a greenish medium blue. Not any where near what the color showed on line. Needless to say I will be returning them. "
Jessie,3 months ago,5,"Excellent! You can feel the quality in the sheets as soon as you lay your hands on them. The sheets are so thick and so finely woven that I do feel like I'm in a resort when I'm sleeping! Of course the sheets were stiff and a tiny bit rough when I first received them. But after washing them, they have become my new paradise. I liked them so much I ordered a second set and I'm getting rid of all my other sheet sets! "
Brenda,a year ago,3,I purchased the split California King sheet set.  When I opened the package the sheets had a terrible smell which did go away when I washed them.  They are not the softest sheets I own.  The material is a little scratchy even after washing.  I like that they fit the bed great.  They have nice deep pockets and are easy to put on.  I like that they come wirh 4 king size pullow cases.  I would purchase this set again. 
Kristi,9 months ago,5,"I began purchasing these sheets for my short term rental property years ago. They are bright (white), thick, soft and feel fantastic. If I do not find it necessary to retire a bottom or top sheet due to a stain, these sheets last a couple of years (washed and dried 150+ times). The double set of pillowcases prolongs the life of the set. These bed linens are a great value. I use and love them (personally), as well. "
KalbyJane,8 months ago,5,These sheets are great quality. Very soft and wash well. I can only sleep with 100% cotton sheets either supima or Egyptian cotton and a high thread count of 400 and above. Cotton sheets are  a breathable fabric for the body. I have tried using other sheets and I keep coming back. These sheets are finished off nicely with piping. Not a lot of wrinkles if removed promptly from dryer but I prefer to iron my sheets. 
Anna,a year ago,5,"I am so happy with these gorgeous high quality, thick cotton sheets! I love them so much I plan to purchase more of them to replace all of my other sheets asap. The quality of the fabric and the stitching detail is unmatched. The fitted sheet has deep “ruched” corners that hug the mattress without any shifting. And you get four (not two!) pillow cases. So beautiful and comfortable. Can’t say enough about these! "
DublinOH,a year ago,4,"A solid value.  There could be more stitches per inch where sewn for better construction.  They are thick, with a good hand feel.  Fabric stays wrinkled even if fetched promptly from the dryer.  These sheets are not as nice as the more expensive Italian, Portuguese or the Wamsutta sheets that used to be sold at BBB.   When these wear out, I would strongly consider this brand if the quality remains consistent. "
Sharon,4 months ago,5,"This set of sheets is probably the best we have ever had and unbelievable for the price.  They come with four....not two...pillow cases and have tags to tell you which is the side and which is the top/bottom of each sheet.  I can't even begin to tell you how much frustration this has saved me.  Additionally, they wash and dry beautifully and the fabric feels amazing.  Highly recommend them without hesitation. "
Gail,9 months ago,5,"These are very nice quality sheets. They wash nicely without wrinkling. They are not as soft as I would like or used too, but the price point makes them a value.The fitted sheet is perfect, it goes on our 16” mattress without any problems.The only negative for me, is the top sheet is barely wide enough to cover a super deep mattress and it is difficult to make nice tucked corners.I would purchase again! "
ConP,10 months ago,4,These sheets are very nice.  The feel is luxurious and size is generous.  Many sheet sets include top sheets that barely cover the mattress.  This top sheet is wide enough to actually tuck in on the sides.  The only reason I didn’t give the sheets a five star rating is because the weave in one 3 inch area of the bottom sheet is defective. I’m sure I could have replaced the set but I was too lazy to do it! 
Lisa,9 months ago,5,"Smooth, soft, and strong - not stiff or flimsy - I’ve tried linen, high thread count cotton, inexpensive cotton, bamboo, etc and all disappoint in some way: too hot, too thin, holes in just 2 years, even noisy!  These wash beautifully and last for several years ( our oldest set is at least 4 years old ) and finally found them again online. I happily bought 2 more sets so all our beds can be comfortable. "
Happy coffee drinker,a year ago,5,"Love these sheets! These are my 2nd set! They are made well, love the fitted edges and, I have to laugh, but the fact that I save a lot of time changing the sheets knowing which edge goes on the front or the side because a tag tells you so! The fitted sheet is larger than most so it’s never a struggle to put down the edges & I love the pillow cases which are oversized.  I will definitely purchase again! "
S Adler,3 months ago,1,Cal king top sheet the stitched border denoting the top is stitched on wrong side. Side to side barely hangs over. Top to bottom is long and goes all the way to floor and more. Thinking it was a defect I ordered another set. Same thing. 
,3 months ago,5,Ordered these sheets for the first time. When received they did have a slight odor. Washed them as we do for all new bedding and they washed up well. No odor and no wrinkles. The sheets are in the thicker side. Definitely not thin or flimsy. Fit our split Cal King mattress well.Just ordered another set.  When we bought our bed the sheets at a mattress store cost twice as much and where much thinner. 
Cluckingham Palace,3 months ago,5,These are beautiful sheets. Nice thread count and fit my tempur-pedic split king wonderfully. I was excited to see a set of split king sheets available on costco.com. I've never seen them in the warehouse. I ordered a set for my grandma as well who is a total sheet snob and she raved about them. The casing the set was packaged in that is made of the same sheet material as the sheets was a nice touch. 
Costcoitesince1990,5 months ago,2,"The fabric is very nice thick sateen. Unfortunately, the manufacturer missed the mark on workmanship regarding the stiching quality, which is very bad. The spacing of the surging stitches are wide apart, and thus provides inadequate reinforcement along the trim. Stitches along the edges of the fitted sheets' corners are even worse, as there is little reinforcement and over some areas the stitching even missed the edges. I anticipate the corner edges of the fitted sheet will rip in a few months if the sheets are used regularly. Overall, the quality doesn't compare to the department store Hotel Collection that I use several sets to alternate. I  bought two sets from Costcoto try out, one for my daughter's room which I can't return because it's been washed. The second set is for our master bedroom, which is unopened but I will definitely return. The low price reflects low quality, sadly. "
Priscilla,a year ago,5,These sheets are really quite nice. I originally purchased a 400 thread count from the warehouse and it just didn’t meet my expectations. These sheets stay in place which is really nice since I have a 16 inch mattress. They are soft and wash well. I’ve washed them weekly and they look as good as new! The beige is a nice color as well as the gray. I will definitely purchase another set in the future. 
Tobe,9 months ago,4,"From the perspective of a 76-year young widower who read numerous reviews of several different brands, my thoughts are pretty simple. Having used them for about a month now I think it's reasonably safe to say they are comfortable in our early fall weather here in northern Nevada and will in all probability outlast me. They appear to be very sturdy while still being comfortable. Time will tell! "
OBX310,a year ago,3,"I purchased four sets of this queen size sheet set. Each purchase was two sets, with all fairness the three other sets are wonderful, the fourth makes me wonder if the same company even made them.  The stitching on the fitted sheet is crooked and alters the fit on the mattress. The pillowcase is so crooked down the side and the overlap at the top it is next to impossible to place on the pillow and doesn't even allow the pillow to expand. To make it even worse, it was ordered online and sent to our vacation home, where we will be for a few months and not home where we could just jump in the car and return them. Very very disappointing. The fabric is nice, but I definitely would not order them online again and advise against. All it takes is once and I am done! Not even comparable to the sheets and pillowcases previously received, the worst quality ever. Obviously, no quality control oversight! "
DJW85,4 months ago,5,"These sheets are of excellent quality and feel luxurious.  I've had them a few weeks and washed them three times so  far.  The weight is perfect.  The top sheet is generously sized and I love that too.  I love that the bottom sheet has a label that distinguishes the top from the bottom and the sides.  The quality is superior, and I am now sorry for all the years I ever bought anything else! "
Happy Shopper,9 months ago,5,"I love these sheets.  Split Cal King sheets are not easy to find and I was very happy when I saw them.  They are large enough that they don't slip off mattresses, are easy to put on, the beige is a great color, I love having 4 pillowcases and most of all they feel amazing.  I am so happy with these that I ordered a second set and I'm thinking of ordering another just to have for the future. "
Deee,4 months ago,3,"The hem is starting to fray after only 2 washes. I would expect to find a few “loose” threads right out of the package, but a little shocked to see the frays after using the sheets, then washing a 2nd time. I’m going to keep an eye on it and return them I’d it gets worse. On the plus side, the sheets feel fantastic! Slightly thick and a very luxurious feel. I love sleeping on these sheets! "
Costco Fan for Life,8 months ago,5,"Excellent quality, substantial fabric with a luxurious feel. I was concerned they would be ""slippery"" when I opened the package & saw the sheen, but these sheets are perfect. I've paid hundreds more for far inferior sheets, and I plan to buy another set. The hems do not curl up & tags on each side simplify bed making. I washed twice before using and no odor issues as other reviewers noted. "
Shelby,8 months ago,2,"Fabric is not soft and smooth.   The corner “gathered” style does hold secure but doesn’t have a tidy look.  After just three washings there is a hole in the fabric in the center of the sheet of about 1/8” that is a result of poor fabric quality. Don’t like the color much, more steel gray than blue.  It’s been a disappointment, but we will use them as king sheet sets are quite expensive. "
gerkee,11 months ago,5,"I am extremely selective about the sheets I sleep on. Although I'm not a big fan of sateen, my #1 requirement was thick, heavy yet breathable 100% cotton sheets. I took a gamble with these since the thread quality and count, in addition to the reviews, were very good. I'm sure glad I did as these have been the best sheets I've ever owned! I look forward to crawling into them each night. "
BikinDan,4 months ago,2,"We usually get the  kirkland 650 tread sheets and love them .  We bought these more expensive higher thread  sheets because they were on sale.  We got the sheets and  washed them first prior to putting on the bed. They felt really soft and nice on first use. After washing again after first use sheets started fraying , so we returned then to Costco. We will stick with the kirkland brand. "
Monica in Maryland,8 months ago,5,These are definitely the gold standard of sheets. I've tried less expensive sheets from Costco and was disappointed with how they wore.  These sheets maintain their integrity after repeat washing.  This is luxury bedding at Costco prices; there is no need to pay more for luxury bedding at department stores.   I love the crisp cool feeling of getting into a bed made with these sheets. 
Hunter240,a year ago,5,"We always have a hard time finding a good set of sheets that are soft, not too hot and are smooth to the touch plus have satin feel to them. But my wife found them! These sheets are the best, so she bought 4 sets to have extras. The packets are deep enough to not require extra elastic across the corners to keep them on. I know I love them and so does she. I think you will also. "
JocelynS,9 months ago,5,"Well, I have traditionally preferred Egyptian cotton sheets above all else but these days the genuine article is almost impossible to find--many imposters calling their product ""Egyptian cotton,"" but they're not.  These 800-count sateen sheets come the closest in quality that I've found...and they don't need to be ironed; the wrinkles drop right out as they come out of the dryer. "
Scott,3 months ago,4,"I bought a set and while it was very well packaged and arrived quickly, I must indicate that even after being washed several times, the fabric is not entirely ""smooth"".  OK, it's far from being ""rough""...yet it's not exactly the smoothest fabric to sleep on.  Please do not misinterpret my comment.  The fabric has ""heft"" and is not inexpensively made. It's very well made in fact. "
Saseo,11 months ago,5,"These sheets never disappoint.  While I'm not thrilled how much the price has gone up over the past few years, the sheet sets are worth every penny in durability and feel.  As I get older, it's important to have a well-fitting sheet without breaking a sweat every time I change the bedding.  I got ""beige"" and it's a beautiful light color.  Perfect for my ""linen"" colored bedding. "
SRQLinda,a year ago,4,"These sheets are a little disappointing, as they are not as soft as I expected them to be from previous reviewers.  They are replacing bamboo sheets which I've had for several years, and bamboo was softer than this cotton.  They are also overly large, so there's a lot to tuck under the mattress, but that's okay.  I do like the color (beige), and they have a nice sateen finish. "
Chincoteaguer,a year ago,5,"When your husband sleeps hot and you sleep half frozen, finding sheets that are comfortable to both is often hard to do. These ""hotel"" quality sheets have a soft feel to hand and body. They laundered well (I dry with woolen balls and no chemicals). Please follow instructions and launder them BEFORE using them as this will remove any smells or finishes that might irritate your skin. I rate them as an excellent value for money because I have a California King very thick mattress and these sheets have elastic all around the bottom sheet PLUS are marked TOP, BOTTOM, SIDE so there is no guesswork. I have arthritis in my hands and pulling and tugging to get a fitted sheet in place is harmful. This was easy. Yes, there is some ""play"" in the bottom sheet which I am pleased with because as my husband tosses or turns, I am not pulled by the too tight sheet. Do not be afraid to buy these. They are indeed HOTEL QUALITY. "
fry boy,4 months ago,5,"so much better than the paper towels i was sleeping on. was really a nice upgrade and its so soft. Got them on a discount promotion for $79 for a CalKing set. Fitted sheet is deep pocket and has labels for ""side"" ""bottom or top"" (hehe) so you dont have to figure it out. had about 3mos. and so far holds up to wash. smells terrible new, so use a heavy duty cycle to remove that.. "
bloor,a year ago,5,"I purchased a grey queen-size sheet set on sale for $79.These Costco sheets really feel like 800 thread count unlike sub $100 800TC sheet sets I have purchased at other stores. Reasonably soft (I am not as picky as some reviewers).  Color uniformity, seam stitching, and fit are excellent.  I will definitely  be purchasing more of these sheet sets next time they go on sale. "
Nikki,4 months ago,4,"These sheets are super soft and feel amazing. They are absorbent and fit with a little extra room(I have the split king). My only concern is although the hem seems solid, After the initial washing (before use) the sheets developed some stringing/shredding even though the hem stayed intact, even after the second washing. The sheets are so nice I decided to keep them anyways. "
Alamogal,a year ago,5,"I washed them as soon as I opened the package, then put them on our bed. My husband and I both love the way they feel and the thickness of the sheets. I like that the bottom sheet is not completely TOO large for the mattress. Yes, it is a bit wrinkled when we get up in the morning but nothing like some of the other sheets I have purchased. I would definitely buy these again. "
Nancy,4 months ago,5,"I ordered 2 sets of sheets; one split king for adjustable bed and one queen size. Wasn't sure I would like the feel because of the sheen out of the packaging, However, once washed and dried both sets have a very nice feel.  The size is generous with excess fabric.  If you have an extra deep mattress these will work great.  Great quality and great [rice!!! Thank you Costco. "
EKidney,4 months ago,3,"These are ok sheets. Love the 4 generous King pillow covers. Sheets are medium weight & not very soft/smooth-hoping they get softer with more washes.  I love that they are cool to the touch so you get a cool spot on your pillow when turning. The fitted is generous in depth. The flat plenty long to stay tucked in but could be wider. Overall, they’re just OK for the price. "
MirandaGT,4 months ago,4,"Lacks the sateen finish that provides a more pleasant feel to sheets.  Otherwise the product is well made and fits my very deep mattress/topper combination. I had previously purchased the less expensive Kirkland sheet set which also fit my mattress/topper combination and had a better feel to it, but those sheets, once washed, appeared to shrink unevenly along the seams. "
Lindapala,a month ago,4,"These are soft and super smooth. They feel great. The size is generous and my fav feature is that the edges are labeled on the fitted bottom sheet. It’s easy to put it on right the first time. The finished edging could be a little better quality,  There is some slight fraying and loose threads. Nothing bad enough to return because I like this set so much. I have 3 sets. "
Blee,a year ago,5,"Excellent quality, fit and feel. I have a deep mattress. Other brands claim to fit, but they never completely fit and pop loose after one night. The Hotel Signature has the extra mid-corner elastic that keeps the sheet in place. If you’re ok making your bed every night, get the cheap sheets. The Kirkland brand is good for the price. These would be considered “high end” "
Anonymous,3 days ago,5,Excellent quality and fit! 
Debra,a year ago,4,"This is the 3rd set of sheets I have bought of this brand. I like that they have a very deep bottom sheet that is very easy to tuck under the mattress, do not wrinkle much and feel nice and soft. I would give them a 5 except they only provide 4 standard size pillow cases when all I want is 2 king size. Also they do not last as long as long as I thought they would. "
Fit hippy chick,4 months ago,5,"These sheets exceeded my expectations.  I was delighted to see the beige color is a very sophisticated pale beige, and the generous fit is perfect.  Having little tabs to indicate ""sides"" and ""top/bottom"" of the fitted sheet is a genius idea and makes making the bed a breeze.  The quality seems very good for the price - so far, I'm very satisfied with my purchase! "
Pamela,9 months ago,5,"Absolutely love them; smooth, soft, extremely well made.  The length of queen flat is perfect as 106 inches.  Plenty of actually properly make the bed with enough to tuck in at bottom of mattress.  Generally, average length of queen flat is 92-102 inches, and cannot be tucked in enough to hold.  They had no smell upon arrived, washed up perfectly per instructions. "
DJMmjm,a year ago,2,Product does not have satine finish we were hoping for. Patterns/blotches shoes up in material after 1sr washing and rewatch did not remove these. 
Big Guy,6 months ago,5,This is my second purchase.   Split cal-king sheets are hard to find.  These have very deep pockets allowing sheets to fit tight and not slip off. 
LM8276,a year ago,5,"Great sheets.  Can't beat the quality for the price (on sale, too!).   I would only suggest that the fitted sheet (I have a Casper king mattress) was a little more fitted and tighter on my mattress.  But, I understand these fitted sheets are made to fit all thickness of mattress brands.    Great product, as always, from Costco.   Would definitely buy another set. "
Missouri Homemaker,5 months ago,2,"I really love these sheets, but I had to return this set.  I noticed after laundering them prior to using, that the stitching on one of the sides of the top sheets was defective, causing the material to split and fray. I returned them to the warehouse and ordered another set.  Hopefully quality control will be more stringent and this problem won't be repeated. "
Terri,a year ago,5,"These sheets are of great quality.....because of the thread count, they a heavier than the average sheets, but very durable, very comfortable and look classy on the bed.Only issue is they are a bit short side-to-side while being very long in the length.They do wash up nicely, wrinkle a bit, but not too much.Overall, we're really happy with this purchase! "
Bruce,4 months ago,4,Softest sheets I've ever slept on. I love these sheets and I've bought several sets. My only reason for not giving hem 5 stars is that some seam threads pull out after a while. I wish I had a sewing machine for an easy repair. My girlfriend actually called me a thread count snob until I bought her a set of these. Now she's singing the thread count dandy lol. 
Patty  D,9 months ago,5,"These sheets have a rich quality I have not seen for anywhere close to this price. I decided to give them a try when I saw they were on sale. They were only available as a online purchase so I didn't know what to expect. It took three weeks for the delivery, and I was not disappointed. They feel like luxury on your skin and I am very happy with the purchase. "
John Henry,2 months ago,5,We had purchased these sheets in the past and were very happy they were still available. They are very nice quality and come with extra pillow cases.     We took a chance and ordered the blue ones hoping they would be more teal after reading the comments and viewing the photographs and we were right.   They are not blue but more teal and just what we wanted. 
SJBQ,9 months ago,5,We absolutely love these sheets. We don't know when we have slept so well. We bought two sets but are going to purchase more. These sheets are easy to put on and even have little tags to differentiate between top/bottom and sides. We also checked another popular web site to see how much they cost there and these are about one hundred dollars less at Costco. 
Ron P,a year ago,4,"Satin feel was excellent. Top sheet was more than adequate but could have been 2"" wider and 2"" shorter in length. The bottom sheets just barely fit. My mattress is 14"" thick. The Costco specs said they fit a mattress up to 18"". Not so. "
Anonymous,4 days ago,2,We purchased these late January 2023 - it is not May 2024 and we are in the market for new sheets as these have disintegrated. They’d be perfect if they were built to last. 
Winehen,a year ago,5,These sheets are soft and most importantly have deep pockets to fit over our mattress. A nice feature is that there are tabs that show which side of the sheet matches the appropriate side of the bed. No more odd-fitting bottom sheet. The top sheet is oversized too for lots of room on our California king. I wish they would offer extra matching pillowcases. 
Gigi,3 months ago,5,"Excellent sheets—nice weight, smooth and comfortable, wash well and are easy to use.  Last year I bought a set of these and a “luxury” brand at the same time, alternating them so I could compare them fairly.  Unfortunately for the luxury brand company, I will continue buying these instead.  The extra pair of pillowcases Costco provides is a nice bonus. "
The Big Cheese,9 months ago,5,"These sheets are soft, luxurious and heavy duty. The corner stitching on the fitted sheet is really well done and grips the mattress completely so it doesn’t  pop off while you sleep. My wife and I bought these sheets to replace our old worn out sheets and these were such a significant upgrade that we both lament having to get out of bed each morning. "
Robin,9 months ago,5,"The Hotel Signature 800 count sheet set is by far the best sheets I’ve ever bought.  A family member recommended them to me and I buy them whenever there is a sale/discount/rebate.  Cool to the touch, easy to wash- with little wrinkles and keeps its shape even after multiple washings and restless sleepers!  Almost all my sheets are now from Costco!! "
Stephanie,a year ago,3,The fabric is nice but the stitching is horrible. Every single piece is riddled with threads and strings from the stitching. It's incredibly sloppy. I've had to pull not-attached threads that are stitched into the seams and cut attached threads that are coming out of the unfinished edging. If I didn't have to ship these back  I'd return and exchange 
Mel818,3 months ago,3,"These sheets are nice to the touch, although to me, they still do not feel like 800 thread count.  That aside, on both sides of the top sheet, after placing them on my bed, I noticed that the edges are frayed!  The finishing/sewing of the edges is not high quality (one weak seam).Price is good, but I have found better quality for about the same $$ "
Brice,3 months ago,4,They’re very nice but think the 680 count would’ve been plenty sufficient for my needs. They’re very nice but think the 680 count would’ve been plenty sufficient for my needs the 800 count seems to have a satin feel to them. I only wanted to try them out as the price was the same as the 680 count. Probably will stick to the 680 count in the future. 
Misses C,9 months ago,3,"Prior to this purchase, I’ve purchased four sets of these sheets. Labeled the same, the fabric is not comparable. It is lighter weight, though labeled percale weave they’re not as smooth, and though I have a fairly new mattress, the bottom sheet is way to deep to snugly fit the bed. I would pay more if  Costco was to bring back the better fabric. "
Mimi,3 months ago,4,"Love the feel of the sheets, however they were defective.  The top sheet had at least four holes in it.  Contacted Costco and replacement sheets were shipped right away.  The replacement sheets did not have damage.  The return process for the damaged sheets was made easy.   I would buy them again...but disappointed that it took two transactions. "
LaDonna,8 months ago,5,I would highly recommend the King Hotel Signature 800 thread count cotton 6-piece sheet set.  The size should fit the largest/thickest king mattress available.  The fabric is excellent quality and washes beautifully.  I purchased the almond color and it is a very neutral shade that blends with most anything.  Very satisfied with this purchase. 
JenB,5 months ago,5,"I bought the cal king and really like them so much I’m buying another set for my trailer. These sheets and pillow cases did arrive with a faint odor so after washing as was recommended with instructions, it went away. Sheets thickened up and are very soft! I like them a lot. There’s absolutely no fraying like other reviews. Highly recommend! "
Miles,a year ago,2,"After finally getting the bag open, I was hit with a horrific Oder.  I quickly unfolded and put them in the laundry.  Washed 3 times!  They are a somewhat stiff fabric and came out of the dryer with wrinkles. Plus 3 of the pillowcases have, what looks like, brown rust stains.  This is not the quality that we have come to expect from Costco. "
Lolee,4 months ago,5,"Loved these sheets because not only are they soft to the touch, but they have a sturdy “hand” (if you sew, you know!) and are super durable.  They come with two sets of pillow cases which is great; I use one as the “liner” the other as the pillow case.  Costco has a high quality product in these sheets - the precise reason we bought them! "
Jolene,a year ago,5,"These sheets last so much longer than any we have used before.  They're smooth and soft and have extra deep pockets for higher mattresses.  One of the best features is that they have labels on the sides, top and bottom of the bottom sheet indicating  how it goes on so there's no more guesswork when trying to put the sheets back on the bed. "
Shelly,8 months ago,5,"I ordered the sheets for the guest bedroom. My son came to visit and stayed in the guest room. A few days after he left he called and wanted to know the brand and where I purchased the bedsheets. He said they were very comfortable, and he wanted to buy them for his bed. The sheets are well made. I ended up ordering them for my bed as well. "
Candy,3 months ago,3,"I had to return it. The stitching on the fitted sheet unravelled when I did the initial wash. The stitching where the elastic is attached needs to be reinforced or better done. The material was a nice weight and felt smooth to the touch, but I wouldn't exactly call it soft. Also the chemical/plastic smell out of the package was really bad. "
Retired RN,10 months ago,2,"We have had these sheets for over 2 years. Toenails and beards cause damage to the fibers so the sheets and pillowcases get rough and pilled. Where the sheet hits my husband's beard, it is frayed and open at the top hem of the sheet where it hits his face. I think the high thread count makes the fibers too fragile to hold up to abrasion. "
Lynn Pete,a year ago,4,"Good quality sheets at a fair price. Not paper-thin like other sheets I've tried recently, so they should hold up well. Also, the hems don't roll up after washing like many others do--a big plus. The extra pillowcases are a nice bonus. Not quite as soft as I hoped for (hence 4, not 5 stars), but they'll probably soften up as I wash them. "
Ricardo,8 months ago,5,Wow - I can't believe I haven't invested in quality bedsheets until my mid-30's. These sheets truly make me feel like I'm staying in a luxurious hotel suite. The quality is incredible and it appears these sheets will last a lifetime as they're quite durable. Looking forward to breaking this more as I learned they get softer through time. 
Mamajones,3 months ago,4,"I bought these as a gift for a very demanding almost 50 male who was upset that he would never find  great sheets like those that were old and ""done!""  He really likes the sheets - great color, super soft & comfy. His only negative comment is that the pillow covers fold inward instead of the old open style.  Hence  4  stars instead of 5. "
TomVO,a year ago,3,Good quality fabric. Poor quality control at factory. The traditional fold at the head of the top sheet was sewn on the side of the sheet. Not a deal breaker but it’s something that Costco should have caught. I’m suspecting they didn’t because the set has a custom size box meaning it’s probably drop shipped and Costco never even sees it. 
PEB123,2 months ago,5,"These are heavy sheets and do very much feel like Hotel sheets to us.  The bottom fitted sheet for our King bed is very easily installed unlike many king sheet sets that are just a bit too snug or small, these fit simply the way they should.  While a heavier high thread count, they feel more silky than most sheets which is very welcome. "
DCarlson,a month ago,4,This is the second set of sheets I have ordered because I loved the first set so much.  They soften with washing  and are nice and cool for sleeping.  The second set I recently bought are perfect except they were not properly hemmed on the sides;  guess they passed quality control somehow.  I would purchase them again in a heartbeat. 
DePo,5 months ago,1,I am disappointed in the quality of these sheets.There are many loose threads and the seams around the elastic (fitted sheet) are ragged.  The quality of the fabric itself is good.  In the past I bought the Egyptian cotton sheets and were happy with them if the thread count is high:  they looked more professionally sewn and durable. 
Thebohemianchef,a year ago,4,"I really love these, They are very expensive feeling. The only thing about them is when I took them out they have a bit of stickiness to them which I think will come off when I wash them. I would have given a 5 star but for that reason and they seem a bit big for my queen bed. I still love them. The pillow cases are a definite 5 :) "
Alana,9 months ago,5,Best sheets ever! Longer on the top sheet sides so we’re not tugging and pulling all night. Silky enough not to cause friction but not so silky they slide around. Bottom sheet has great elastic and deep enough for our adjustable bed with deep corners. Comes with 4 queen pillowcases which is a rarity lately. Will be ordering more. 
BSUfan,4 months ago,1,"Something went terribly wrong with delivery of this item, so I have no idea of the sheets are good or not.  UPS said there was no such address as mine, even tho they delivered here before; I called Costco to intervene and they just handed me off to UPS, who kept insisting my address was no good.  I ended up just cancelling order. "
KAD1,5 months ago,5,"I couldn't be more pleased with the quality of these sheets! From the moment the package arrived, I could tell by the size of it that these sheets were superior in thickness. Other sets (purchased elsewhere) were about half the size! Also, the proportions are generously sized for my California King bed. No struggling to stretch the fitting sheet over all four corners of the mattress. The flat sheet was also generously sized, easily dropping to the bottom edge of the mattress and even more so at the foot of the bed. The folded and hemmed edge at the top of the flat sheet was broad and sewn well, unlike some other sheets where it is so narrow it's hard to tell which side of the sheet goes at the head of the bed! The pillowcases easily accommodated our king size pillows. I was so pleased with the quality and value of this set that, after a night sleeping between these luxurious sheets, I decided I had to order a second set. Again, I couldn't be more pleased! "
NH member,4 months ago,2,I’ve had these sheets for a few months. Washed more than once a week attempting to soften them and they still feel like they were dipped in permanent heavy duty starch from the dry cleaners.  No pilling or wrinkles though. Deep corner pockets fit 13” thick mattress. Maybe they need to be washed daily like they would be by a hotel 
Hooked on Costco,2 months ago,5,"I love the Costco Hotel Signature 800tc cotton sheets, the quality is amazing! I have these in my guest rooms and always get complimented on them as well as asked where I got them. They have deep pockets as well as tags on the sides or top/bottom to identify which way to place the sheets when making the bed. Well worth the money! "
ralfherr,9 months ago,1,"Good quality, nice color, fair price (during promotion) "
Anonymous,a year ago,3,Fraying around the edge. Very disappointed! 
JBarley,4 months ago,5,"These sheets are gorgeous & luxurious! They are soft without being slippery, and have strategically placed elastic in the corners. They are a much heavier fabric than most all other sheets, which means rough heals won’t wear holes in them. The pillow cases are a bit longer than standard, so pillows stony stick out…and you get 4. "
CFierro,4 months ago,5,"I adore these sheets! I bought them for the first time a number of years ago in the store, and bought them for a second time online. They are so smooth, “as smooth as butter” as the old saying goes and when I climb into bed with them it is like heaven. Highly recommend these sheets as they are priced right and never disappoint. "
Earl,4 months ago,5,"These sheets fit over our deep king size mattress nice and snug. They seem slightly larger than other king size sheet sets... plenty of material to tuck under at the corners with the top sheet... extra spandex around the bottom sheet helps with the good fit. They are soft, very comfortable, and stay in place. Love these sheets! "
Mary in Sacramento,3 months ago,5,"I bought these sheets in Queen size, white. Very well sewn in the corners so they can stand up to the stress.  Top quality cotton in a sateen finish with nice detailing on the pillow cases and top sheet. These sheets wear well and wash and dry with minimal wrinkles. You can buy cheaper sheets, but not better ones at this price. "
Lisa,9 months ago,4,When I opened these the smell was HORRIBLE. I washed them 3 times and the smell went away. I have 2 king sets already but I needed a queen set for our RV. Love how the elastic is very strong to fit over the mattress.The material is very soft to the touch and they wash really well. Would give these 5 stars except for the smell. 
Costco10,8 months ago,5,"Worth the wait and price. I’m very particular about sheet fitting, texture weight etc, and these are AMAZING. Bonus that top sheet is extra long and no wrinkles out of dryer. I expected dry time to be longer since quite heavy, but dried very fast. They’re sooo dreamy!Debating to just buy another set now for future backup. "
NASA Bob,4 months ago,2,These are noisy sheets.  I wear a fitbit and the one night we slept on these sheets I got the lowest score for sound sleep I have ever gotten in the last three years since I got my fitbit.  We removed them immediately.  We did not know sheets could be noisy.  We will be returning them to Costco the next time we go to Costco. 
Miller10,a year ago,3,"I have 4 sets of the precious Hotel Signature 800 TC that they stopped selling. Absolutely the best sheets!   Them came the Hotel Signature 800 TC Antimicrobial sheets and they were like microfiber.  Returned right away.  These sheets we all thought were like the original, not even close. Not as thick and soft. Very sad. "
SwimmerDude,9 months ago,5,"These sheets are hefty all-cotton with an absurdly high thread count, fitted sheets that are elasticised all the way around with orientation labels for the sides and top/bottom, and four pillow cases.  It also comes with a velcro-fastened pouch for your sheets that you will never, ever get your sheets back into,ever again. "
Vegas Babe,4 months ago,1,"My rating is not for the sheets themselves but for the manner in which they were packaged and mailed.  Upon delivery, the small compressed box had broken and appeared to be messily retaped.  The filthy dirty plastic was protruding out of the corner edges of the box.  I returned the box intact the next day at local Costco. "
Karen 007,a year ago,5,"I just put these on my bed.  Years prior I used a popular furnishing store brand because they sold individualized fitted sheets.  But they drove me crazy because they never quite fit right.  They were just a little too snug and always came up on one side.  The fitted sheet in this set is a whole other class.  It fits perfectly.  And it has a thick elastic band all around.  The pillow cases are huge, but can easily be sewn to fit.  I really wish Costco offered just the fitted sheet.  I don't typically use a top sheet on a king size.  I also bought a king set from a well known pillow company to compare.  While the famous pillow brand was comfortable enough, their sheets were transparently thin. The difference is price was maybe around $35.  Definitely worth paying more for these.  I believe these Costco Hotel Signature sheets will last awhile.  I will be putting my old fitted sheets that never fit right into the rag pile, and buying a few more sets of these sheets. "
Randy,4 months ago,2,"As several members had written mentioning the edges of the sheets by the seam unraveling , I purchased anyway. Upon receiving I promptly washed them to have them ready for use. When I took them out of the dryer I noticed the edges had started to unravel as other people had mentioned. Still debating as to taking them back "
Me too,a year ago,5,"If you have ever gone to a nice Hotel and experienced the thick cotton sheets and wished, you could have those at home. These are those exact sheets. These are not the thinner silk type sheets that some people also like. These are the thick sheets that hotels use because they are constantly washing their sheets everyday. "
Vangi,4 months ago,5,These sheets are by far the best quality sheets on the market.  The 800 thread makes them the strongest and therefore do not form holes over time.  They are soft and wrinkle free.  I have purchased very expensive sheets and they wore out in a year.  These sheets are extraordinary and I hope COSTCO will always sell them! 
Blulynx,4 months ago,5,I have purchased several sets of these sheets from Costco over the last 10 years but these are by far the best! They are perfect fit for my queen mattress and they feel like silk! It’s hard to believe they are 800 cotton thread count without something else in the mix! I love them! Plus they don’t wrinkle! What a find! 
mamabear,a year ago,5,"These sheets are high quality and well made. They are a little stiff right out of the package, but they have softened with each wash. The only thing that would make the set better, is if the pillow cases had that fold over flap on the inside to keep the pillow from sticking out. I will definitely purchase these again. "
DPickett,4 months ago,1,Took weeks to arrive 
LA shopper,a year ago,3,"What is that smell?  I think it was likely the plastic packaging but the smell when they arrived was just hideous. I had to wash the sheets twice on a long cycle to get rid of it. But, yes, it can be washed out. The sheets are stiffer and thicker than expected but I think they will get softer after a few more washes. "
Patti,4 months ago,5,I love these sheets. I purchased a set a while back and waited for them to go on sale again so I could purchase another set. The two colors I have - gray and dark blue aren’t as deep in color as they appear in the picture but I still love the way they feel and wash up. They look beautiful on the bed and feel so nice. 
palmlyn,a year ago,5,"I can only rate on my first impression not the long term quality or durability, but these sheet seem a very good value for the quality. They appear to be well made, thick and washed well the first time around. They are soft, but again are somewhat heavy due to the weave and thread count. I will buy  additional sets. "
TEE M,9 months ago,5,"these sheets are fantastic. very soft and the material is a heavier weight than I have had before. Will hold up for years. After purchasing one set,and putting them on our bed, I ordered another set before the sale was over. Also pleased that I was able to order a split king set. Not many retailers have that option. "
Lainie,9 months ago,3,"Unfortunately, I had to return these as the hem of one of the pillow cases was sewn in a crooked manner. The fabric seemed quite nice, but I cannot attest to what it felt like while sleeping. The set did feel a little heavy for summer sleeping. I bought a different thread count set while in the store for the return. "
Anonymous,19 days ago,5,"I love these sheets!  I have bought two sets for myself and one for my sister.  I love the custom fit of the bottom sheet, the top sheet has extra coverage, they don't fade, they remain soft (no pilling) and the extra bonus is the label on the fitted sheet that says top and bottom!  I'd pay double for this quality! "
Evtplnr,4 months ago,5,My husband says throw the old sheets away!  These came out of the wash/dryer feeling very soft and  luxurious….and almost wrinkle free.  You can tell the cotton is high thread.  A bonus getting 4 pillow cases and the top sheet is extra long.  You can’t beat the price.  Also sent a couple sets to my daughter-in-law. 
Peej,a year ago,5,"Totally went on the reviews that others had written to try out these sheets.  So glad I did!  They are really great and the price was terrific.  They washed well and I did not have to iron them.  Yes, I usually iron my sheets.  They feel silky soft but also have a good weight to them.  Very Happy with my purchase. "
GeorgeAC,a year ago,4,"Queen came with flat and fitted sheets and 4 queen-size pillow cases.  Even though description said ""two standard pillow cases.""  My older comforter and these two sheets keep me warm and toasty in Michigan winters.  No blanket needed.  The 800 thread count must block all the cold air and is smooth and comfortable. "
SoCalKen,a year ago,5,"These are beautiful sheets of excellent quality.  The tags identifying the tops and sides of the fitted sheet are quite useful in avoiding frustration.  Both sheets and pillow cases are of sufficient size, making it easy to change the bedding.  The set comes with four pillow cases, a must as I have four pillows. "
Goldie,a year ago,5,"My favorite sheets. These are soft and smooth for great sleeping. They wash up great and wear like iron. I’ve never had a set that wore out - and I’ve used Costco Signature sheets for many years. If I head for my linen closet, I have them in a rainbow of colors. Great sheets at a great price. What’s not to like? "
Wise Doc,3 months ago,5,"Bought king size sets in blue and beige.  Both are beautiful colors.  This 6-piece cotton bedding set feels luxurious to the touch, the fitted sheet fits perfectly — neither too loose nor too snug (unlike some other fitted sheets), and it washes/dries very well without wrinkling.  Very pleased with the purchase. "
TXDOT,8 months ago,5,I love these white sheets. They are soft and smooth as silk.  The directions are to wash on a delicate cycle. The sheets come out of the dryer very smooth. These sheets are very well made. The fabric will last for years.  I noticed review complaints about wrinkling. Maybe they used the wrong wash and dry cyle. 
Sunny brook,a month ago,5,"I have had these sheets for a year now, they still look and feel brand new! They haven’t shrunk up! The corners still fit perfect. No fighting over the top sheet, it’s still wide enough for the king bed. They even marked in the inside tag which is the side and which is the bottom for the fitted sheets. Love them "
Year round itchies,a year ago,5,"Soft and supple, these sheets feel like a dream. They wash well and last for years. I bought one set that has outlasted all others bought elsewhere. Now we have these sheets on all beds in our house! This is a better investment than the cheaper sheets that wear out more quickly and wash poorly. Worth the money. "
aacneil,a year ago,5,"Love my new sheets.  Absolutley beautiful and super sized, the queen flat and pillow cases are the longest I've ever received.  Smooth and crisp.  Had to ship them to the border and arrange a courier to broker them during the winter but totally worth the extra steps.  Only wish they had carried them in Canada. "
RCCC18,a year ago,3,"Quality set of sheets, but the pillowcase description indicates (4) standard pillowcases 21"" x 33"". The included pillowcases are 21"" x 40"" (king size pillowcases). We want standard pillowcases, and the description is what drove our purchase. Even yet, I would recommend this product with the correct description "
Robert,9 months ago,2,"First night sleep in them not comfortable at all even after they were washed. Actually not smooth, but rough. Makes me wonder about the material. Like others highlighted, they are not snug around the mattress. They are not quality even given the 800 thread count. They are going back. Need good American cotton! "
Stacy,9 months ago,5,"This is nice and lasted very long.  I have had it for 2 years and 2 different colors.  I swap them when changing King-size sheet sets.  If you wanted something similar and about $20 cheaper.  Kirkland 680 counts luxury sheets will be very good too.  Although, I wish it comes with 4 pillow cases instead of two. "
Maltese,9 months ago,5,The Fitted ones on a split California King stay on the mattress without constantly coming off like other brands in the past. They are very comfortable. Pricey but you get what you pay for. Other brands do not last like these are. I like the fact that you get 3 king pillow cases instead of 2 like other brands. 
Sleep Tight,a year ago,5,Read the reviews of others and had doubts about buying these sheets. Glad we did. Have had them on about 2 months. They are substantial and sturdy and smooth and soft and have no objectional odors that others complain about. We like them a lot and will definitely purchase them again next time they go on sale. 
Carol,3 months ago,5,"I only buy all cotton sheets, and this set is wonderful.  The sheets are substantial without being too heavy.  The fitted sheet has deep pockets, and has tabs to show where the sides/top/bottom are so no more guesswork!  They dry soft to the touch without fabric softener.  I'm very happy with this purchase! "
Annette,a year ago,4,"So far so good. Only had a couple weeks so if they hold up would have given a higher rating as more time passes.  One negative though, there was a foul odor to the packaging and sheets when they first arrived.  Fortunately, the smell washed out of the sheets but the package had to be thrown out immediately. "
Lisa,4 months ago,5,I ordered these sheets as a treat to myself as I had been sleeping in hand me down sheets. I am very happy with them. They feel great and they are not too heavy or too light. I feel like I’m staying in an expensive hotel.  The sheets was extremely well priced for the great quality. I highly recommend them. 
Robert2012,9 months ago,3,"I was expecting sheets that would be very soft to the touch and comfortable, especially given the rave reviews. I’m not sure if the materials changed recently, but I am not impressed with these sheets! It’s not particularly soft and it’s a bit crinkly. They’re good enough to keep but I wouldn’t buy again. "
Stacy,25 days ago,5,If you have a split King XL these are the sheets for you. What makes these sheets so great is that the top sheet is extra long so it doesn't come untucked from the bottom. Game changer for me! And it doesn't hurt that they are soft and comfortable. They did smell when they arrived but one wash fixed that! 
Been There,a year ago,5,"Fabric is good. Washed up nicely without edges wrinkling up. Only complaint is the flat sheet had a lot of loose threads along top stitching. I trimmed them and it didn’t seem like it would cause future raveling. First time splurging on sheets so was disappointed I had to “fix” them, but was simple to do. "
Jack,8 months ago,5,"I love the feel of cotton on my skin so I try to buy, nothing but, cotton.  Most sheets are microfiber and thin and just don't feel right to me.  I grew up with thick cotton sheets dried on the clothes line.  These are 100% cotton and thick like I grew up with.  I just love these sheets (I bought 4 sets). "
damatapa,3 months ago,4,Excellent quality sheets-Almost wrinkle free from the dryer- I don't have to iron! Ample size to fit over deep mattress without a struggle.Would have given 5 stars but the sewing is a bit faulty- almost all areas where there is stitching has hanging threads that are unsightly and need to be cut/trimmed. 
ims121,a year ago,5,These sheets are very nice and comfortable.  I just started to use them and they seem to fit very well with the correct dimensions to fit the bed (CA King).  I was somewhat concerned when we took the sheets out of the packaging because the smelled terrible.  The odor was eliminated after the first wash. 
RamJet,9 months ago,3,"These sheets felt very nice when we got them. We washed them as stated on the package, and put them on the bed. Unfortunately it’s says fits up to 18” mattress.  Our mattress is only 12-15”, and the bottom sheet skids all over, 2 big. Sheets should not be 1 size fits all.  We will be returning both sets "
CAM1,a year ago,3,"The quality of the workmanship on these sheets was disappointing. Ragged stitching on the seam ends. Puckers on inside of the pillow cases where there should be none. Not what I expected in sheets at this price point. The quality of the fabric itself is excellent, it’s just the workmanship that is poor. "
Satisfied Costco Shopper,3 months ago,5,"Very nice, soft, non-scratchy linens that wash very well with no pilling or changes to shape/size of product. Extremely comfortable to sleep on, stay in place during the night, and make it so much easier to make the bed in the morning than having to practically remake it from scratch. Highly recommend. "
teachermommy,a month ago,2,"The sheets have a satin embroidery stitch on the top of the sheet and around the pillowcases.  The tension between the top thread and the bobbin thread is too tight and it created ""runs"" in the fabric.  I think this will affect the wear and longevity of the set.  Fabric is nice,  overall, disappointed. "
Naty82,a year ago,5,"These sheets are high quality, they are soft, thick, and durable... have had them for almost 4 years and they still look like new even though I wash them with bleach and hot water every other week.  Highly recommend them I'm about to purchase another set I just wish they had twin sizes for kids' bed "
beeegal,9 months ago,5,"Love that they have labels for top/bottom.   Love that the fitted sheet is roomy enough to fit a very thick mattress as well as thinner….mine is only 14” and the sheet tucks in nicely with no extra fabric.    And, most of all, love the feel.   Will definitely buy again….cant beat the price with Costco. "
Chris,a year ago,4,"Sheets are soft and thick and comfortable. One note: they do collect lint and pet hair very easily. However, about 10 quick rolls/disposable sheets of a sturdy, sticky lint roller before removing the fitted sheet from the bed will suffice to remove it before washing time. (We don’t use a flat sheet.) "
MichelleSoCal,4 months ago,5,"I have bought these sheets for years. I love the QUALITY, softness and the fit. They wash up so nice and they also come with 2 sets of pillow cases. The Flat sheet has the corner technology that makes them STAY in place. I ordered 2 sets because I love them so much.  I hope Costco keeps these around. "
Debbie,2 months ago,5,I love these sheets. I wanted a more hotel feel type sheet and these fit the bill. They are thicker than a lot of others I’ve bought but still very soft. Washed twice and no problems. Top sheet is wider than so many other brands so it covers 2 people comfortably. Will definitely purchase another set. 
SEBG,9 months ago,5,"These sheets are terrific! I was anxious for them to arrive, as I am always searching for sheets that are comfortable. They are very smooth, and a high quality fabric. They washed beautifully! I especially appreciated the ease of putting on the bottom sheet. I will be adding some for out guest room. "
Sushi Judi,10 months ago,5,"I purchased the blue set in Aug 23 and am enjoying them now.  High quality, weight, drape, weave.  Others complained of smell, and my first sniff reminded me of goat shed in monsoon season - so I washed them, just like the label directed and they are now perfect.  I did need to trip several threads. "
Roni,9 months ago,4,"Fabric is very nice, silky smooth. The only trouble I've had is that our older sleep number mattress is only 15"" deep and the kings are good ""through 18"" so I'm not able to keep them quite as tight as I'd like. But this isn't just a costco thing...have had trouble with others over the years as well. "
Darlene T,8 months ago,5,"This sheet set ticks all the boxes.  The extra 4 inches of width and length for the top sheet are wonderful.  The hand is great, too.  They are comfortable from the first use, and get softer with each washing.  The bottom sheets easily fit the deep mattresses.  I will be buying these again, for sure "
Lisa,4 months ago,5,"The 800 thread count bed sheets are very nice, but I was shocked to see the lousy box they were shipped in.  Cardboard box was so thin and one corner of the box was ripped!  Luckily the sheets inside were fine.  I give the shipping a D-  and next time I'll just physically go to Costco to buy them!!! "
IBoughtSheets,a year ago,5,"My standards might not be luxury-level, but these are thick and comfortable but not hot.  I'm a fan.  White is white, no opinion on the color.  Also, a little wrinkly, and some people may take issue with that, but it's always covered by a comforter, so there is no reason to get worked up about it. "
Colleen O,4 months ago,5,These sheets are wonderful!  We have a tempurpedic mattress and it can run hot. These sheets are cool to the touch and easy to put on. Top sheet is long enough to tuck under and stay. Beige color has a hint of grey which works for us. Launders well and not too wrinkly. Would absolutely buy again. 
Jess,5 months ago,4,"Great product. They are very thick and fit well. The only negative is that when you are in bed they make a lot of noise when you move in bed. I have only washed them once, so not sure if they would get softer with time. Still worth purchasing and I would even considering purchasing a second pair. "
J Graham,7 months ago,2,"I purchased two sets of sheets.  One set was fine.  The other just did not fit the bed.  The fitted sheet was just too big.  I even looked at the tag to make sure I had picked up King sheets.  Unfortunately, since I like to wash my sheets before I place them on my bed I can no longer return them. "
Deven,4 months ago,5,"These were only available online, my local stores didn't have them, although the 600 thread could are good too, these 800 thread count are the best!  I've had my first set of these 800 thread count for years and when I saw these were on sale I jumped on it to get another set.  Highly recommend!! "
Cold,9 months ago,3,"I have purchased these sheet’s before and would rate the older ones a 5.  The ones I bought recently, after being washed have a lot of threads coming out of the top sheet seams.  Looks like the raw edge under the seam wasn’t finished off correctly.  Not sure if the seam will continue to unravel. "
Richard klu,4 months ago,2,After the second wash the fabric is starting to look worn out. I purchased all white.  I bought them because they came with 4 pillow cases and I’m happy about that. I hope they don’t end up as drop cloths for when i paint. It’s starting to look that way.  Expensive painting drop cloths …oh no 
Emmrrl,a year ago,5,"I love getting into bed every night with these sheets! Especially Sundays when I wash them and they are super tight, snug and smooth! They are like sleeping in high quality, luxury hotel sheets. They are perfect for winter as the weight is pretty heavy, I will use my Kirkland 650 thread count sheets for the summer. Which by the way, are just as soft as these sheets! I highly recommend them, too!! I am a sheet snob and over the past 15 years I’ve purchased about 10 sets, different brands, and these two are hands down the best! One thing I have found by accident is that white sheets are always softer than color, this was true across all brands. I have confirmed that the dyes change the feel of the fabric. I was never a huge fan of white, but now it’s all I buy. All of the positive reviews I read about these sheets are spot on. I wanted to weigh in and add my opinion. I did buy a second set!! Many people said they’ve been waiting for Costco to bring these back, so I made sure to buy a back up! "
LoveDIY,4 months ago,5,"I'm pleased with these sheets! I bought queen and they fit my mattress just fine. The fabric is heavier than I expected. That's okay with me because I think they will last longer. After washing a few times, they have softened. I would buy them again. Extra pillowcases are typical Costco value! "
Anonymous,7 days ago,1,"I was initially pleased with the weight and texture of these sheets. They felt very luxurious. However, after less than 6 months of use the fitted sheet became very pilled. I expected better from expensive, high thread count sheets. Thank goodness for the Costco return policy! "
Anonymous,6 days ago,3,"Everything but the fitted sheet is good.  The quality of the fabric is also good.  However, the bottom sheet is much too large to stay snug on the mattress.The previous set of sheets I bought several years ago fit very nicely.  This set is a disappointment. "
LRLB,a year ago,5,"These are my favorite sheets. After purchasing many sheets from various in store and online sources, these are the best. The quality is superior with extra deep fitted corners and impeccable stitching. The color is elegant and the feel is soft while still seeming durable. Highly recommend! "
Brenda,a year ago,5,"We love these super soft sheets.  They don't ravel off the corners of the matress.  I normally don't spend that much on a set of sheets, but I'm glad I splurged. I'm actually planning on buying another set, (different color) the next time they go on sale. Costco has great quality products! "
mdgd,9 months ago,5,I bought these for Christmas gifts in the past and people loved them!  I purchased again because they were loved. I appreciate that there are four pillow cases. I now watch for these to go on sale and get them. I bought three sets this year for gifts again and I’m sure they will be loved! 
Cassandra,8 months ago,5,We had purchased a set of these sheets at the warehouse.  After years of use they finally wore out and we were glad to purchase them again online.  The fitted sheet stays on and I like the indicator for top/bottom and side of sheet.  Like that 4 pillowcases are included and not just two. 
Peggy,4 months ago,4,Good quality sheets.  The top sheet is nice and long so it stays tucked in without being short sheeted.  It is nice to get 4 pillow cases but I do wish they had the envelope closure to hold the pillow in place.  These are very comfortable to sleep on and I would buy this sheet set again. 
Jess W,a year ago,5,"These sheets feel so good on your skin, I wash mine every 4 days and they still look new after 2 years. My favorite part is the labels on the inside of the fitted sheets that designate “side” or “top/bottom” so you always know what side you’re holding. Making the bed is easier than ever! "
Janice,8 months ago,5,"Love them.   Smooth, wrinkle free and easy to put on the bed.  The color is not the beige I expected.  It has a greenish tint to it, but actually is a perfect match to the Costco comforter I bought a few years ago.  I am happy!   I hope these Hotel Signature 800s will be offered again. "
Jane in Tulsa,9 months ago,5,"These sheets are just the best! You can't beat the quality and the price. I've had a set for 2 years, and I still love it. I recently got a set for my son for his birthday, because he and his wife have a new home, and I know he appreciates things like this. He was very happy to get it. "
Nancy,a year ago,5,"These sheets are honestly the best l’ve ever purchased! I am an older lady (62) and have bought many sheets over the years, and these are excellent quality. They have nice deep pockets, with strong elastic, and it’s a plus that the fitted sheet is labeled with top/bottom and side tags. "
Addie Brownell,5 months ago,5,The Hotel Sheets we ordered from Costco are so luxurious. My husband and I noticed the better quality of the sheets the first night we put them on our bed. I know they are higher priced than we have paid for our bed sheets in the past but the feel of the 800 thread count are amazing! 
Cookieshopping,4 months ago,5,Very happy to see these sheets available again. Absolutely love them. They get better as they are washed and used. And  even though I didn’t really need them just yet I put them away for when I do. They are thick but soft and reminds me of a good hotel bedding / hence the name lol. 
Anonymous,25 days ago,2,"So, I ordered two sets off these sheets and have been using for a little more than a year.   The top sheet and pillowcases have held up OK, however the bottom sheet has tears show up unexpectedly.  So as nice sheet set is basically ruined as you cannot order a single bottom sheet. "
Ginger M,9 months ago,5,"Cool crisp cotton. These sheets are exactly what I was shopping for. I don't mind that I can hear movement against these crisp sheets when I slide them around or rollover. I like that I sleep cool and they don't cling to me. They do not drape heavy, but are think and I hope durable. "
LVAmanda,3 months ago,3,"Average quality, not worth the price I paid or what I usually expect from Costco products.i had to cut stray strings from all 4 corners of the fitted sheet. Feels synthetic rather than cozy and soft. Not terrible enough to return or not use, but I think I over paid for these sheets. "
No Name,4 months ago,3,The fabric is excellent and the sheets wash and dry beautifully. I’m just not pleased with the way the bottom sheet fits the mattress. It does not grip the corners of the mattress at all well  resulting in it slipping off the corners and bunching up in the middle when we are sleepin 
Maria,3 months ago,3,"Sheets are wonderful feel great,wash great!! Only one of the skeet sets the workman ship was not so good.  The sawing machine must had some issues had to cut off lots of threads.Did not have time to return to for exchange since had company coming over.Still great set off sheets. "
LucysFriend,a month ago,5,"These sheets are comfortable, wash up with very few wrinkles, fit easily on most width mattresses and are made with longer cotton fibers so the sheets will not pill.  This is my third set for various beds in the house.  My guests even made a comment about the comfort of the sheets. "
Carol,9 months ago,4,"The fabric is so nice; smooth, soft and comfortable.  Previously purchased the ""Kirkland"" 600 thread count split sheets and they fit perfectly. The Hotel brand fitted sheet is bigger than needed and bunches up a lot.  If it fit more snugly I would have given the set a 5 star rating "
Chris H,3 months ago,5,These were a gift for our son living in another state.  He and his girlfriend love it and are very happy.  They love the feel (softness) of it.  We'll have first-hand knowledge when we visit them later this year.  The others were for their guest rooms beds which hardly get any use. 
JinSD,4 months ago,2,These sheets have been washed three times now and still feel a bit stiff but my big complaint is the size of the fitted sheet.  We have a pretty thick mattress but there is no way to get the bottom sheet tight. There is loose fabric on the top of the mattress. Wouldn’t buy again. 
Lizzy,9 months ago,2,The sheets are super soft and do feel like hotel sheets.  They are high quality in themselves but the problem we encountered is that they weren’t sewn well and the stitching was off so two pieces that should have been together were apart.  Unfortunately we’ll have to return them. 
JessBrad,a year ago,4,It’s always hard to find quality sheets. High thread count doesn’t always equate to soft and comfortable so it was nice to rely on the usual Costco quality. Great sheets - Nuf said. Be advised that the fitted sheet is really deep and probably won’t fit as tight as a normal sheet. 
Aching body,4 months ago,4,High quality product!  Pleasantly surprised.     Less $ than Company Store and Brooklinen yet pretty comparable.    Getting them on sale means we paid less than half for the fancy store products.    We replaced some Costco sheets and now won't buy the costco brand for this again. 
LisaH,9 months ago,4,"These sheets are lovely.  They feel soft and they are deep and easily cover our thick mattress and the 3"" topper.  Color is beautiful (light blue).    They wash nicely.  They seem to be thinner than the sheets I just replaced them with is the only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars. "
Debilunq,5 months ago,5,"The best sheets ever!  I have them and now my 91 yr. old mom has them, too.  The quality is superb, down to the tag on each side telling whether it is the top/bottom or side.  And they are so soft!  I've had mine for years and they are like the day I took them out of the package. "
Sheet snob,a year ago,5,"I waited 3 months to see how these sheets held up, they are great after about 20 washings and still look great high-quality cotton very well made with additional elastic on the corners to keep th in place.  I have had Matteo and Frette sheets and these are as good if not better. "
MarilynN,4 months ago,5,"The wait is over…works well with the pillow top mattress since there’s deeps corner pockets; not to mention, it’s a very comfy cotton. Also quite a bonus to get four pillow cases with a sheet set, since most sets elsewhere contain two and I always need to buy another set of two! "
Wayne,10 months ago,3,"These sheets are a heavier weight than the patterned set that was sold last year. They had loose strings along some of the edges and after washing, they developed some roughened patches. Overall they are fine, but they are not the quality we were expecting for the price we paid. "
Lesliekehoe2,a year ago,5,"These are very high quality sheets. I was not expecting too much given the price, but was really surprised how well made these are. Additionally, if you sleep warm like I do, these are the ideal sheets as they start cool and stay cool all night long.I need more of these sheets! "
Anonymous,3 months ago,3,The sheets are really nice but the workmanship is poor.  The side seems had loose threads along the whole length and could unravel with the pull of a thread. We returned them for replacement and will look more closely before washing and putting them on the bed. Fingers crossed! 
Jules F,a year ago,5,"We have been buying/using Costco  lower thread count sheet sets for over a decade, and always liked them. This set blew us away though. Out of the package, they were noticeably heftier and more polished than previous sets we've had. They came out of the wash much nicer as well. "
Disappointed8,5 months ago,1,These are horrible. They feel like they are made of plastic. They feel scratchy. Not the least bit soft. I am so disappointed. I had cheap polyester sheets and these are way worse than those! I am returning them asap. Do not be fooled. I feel fooled by Costco and advertisement. 
Ccamp123,3 months ago,5,"The sheets feel silky and the fitted sheet is made to stay on your bed.  But the real excitement comes from having each side of the sheet labeled as to the orientation - ""top"" and ""side"" on all 4 sides.  It makes the job of changing the sheets on your bed just a little faster. "
Beth,a year ago,5,Love these sheets and give them a A+.  They are soft while having a little crispness and they wash up beautifully!  They have small “top/bottom” tags to help when making up the bed. Never knew how helpful these would be.  A great value for the money and I definitely recommend. 
none,7 months ago,5,"I love these sheets!  I’ve tried many different brands over the years.  These are truly the best!  I love the deep pockets of the fitted sheet, the sheen on the fabric and the non wrinkle feature.  They go on the bed and look great right out of the dryer!  You will love them! "
Rose,4 months ago,5,Love the silky feel of these generously sized quality sheets. They were $20 off so that helps too. Real proof will be in how they hold up to washing etc. The dryer kills the elastic on the fitted sheets so I don't run the hottest setting & maybe take them out before 100% dry. 
ShannonJ,5 months ago,4,These are the smoothest sheets I’ve ever slept on and they wash up very well.  My only complaint is they’re not very snug which makes them rather frumpy looking on my adjustable bed.  They do stay on though so I’ll take the frumpy look in exchange for the comfort and quality. 
Vpet,a year ago,4,"I’m still on the fence about these sheets.  They are very thick yet soft, but not as soft as a 400 count cotton sheet.  I’m hoping with time and washings, they will have a better feel to them.  This is my first set of 800 count sheets so perhaps their feel is to be expected. "
Jilly,9 months ago,4,"I’ve ordered about five 800 thread count sets over the past 4 years, the quality has been all over the place.  Sometimes crisp and really heavy, or like these, silky with a beautiful sheen… the actual characteristics differ, but they’ve always been a very pleasant surprise!! "
Anonymous,4 months ago,5,"These sheets are the perfect balance of thread count, weight and texture. I have bought higher thread count sheets and find them too silky to the touch and missing that cotton feel. I also love the weight of these sheets. If you buy them and don’t like them, send them to me! "
Sydsmom,9 months ago,5,"Very high quality, my husband commented how nice they felt!  Also very deep accommodating our Novafoam topper. We normally spend 3 times as much at a major department store!  I will be buying another set and love 4 pillowcases included!! 👍🏼 You can always count on Costco!! "
Jadestone Girl,4 months ago,4,Not a huge fan of satin cotton sheets. I like a crisper feel. But these sheets are comfortable & well made. My only wish is that the fitted sheet was more generous on my 18” mattress. It doesn’t pop off. But coverage could be greater if more fabric was used on fitted sheet. 
RodneyAir,a year ago,5,"These are great sheets, soft and hardly any wrinkles after laundering.  They look and feel like the good quality they are.  This is my second set from Costco.  These came with a darling small embroidery at the top.  Glad I found these after searching elsewhere for too long. "
One of Nice,7 months ago,3,"I purchased this in July and have been sleeping on it for a few months, and I'm so disappointed with the sizing.  The size is too large for my queen-sized bed; it's just too big, and I'm constantly putting the bottom sheet back on the mattress in the morning.  Frustrating. "
Melcr,7 months ago,5,I bought these sheets after a friend of mine said her bougie friends love these sheets. I really like the feel and look of Sateen sheets and they don’t wrinkle either. Super soft. I bought the beige color and looks great with my pretty headboard. Wish they had more colors. 
Matt M,8 months ago,2,"The sheets are not as soft as one would think - Definitely not worth the price. Also when they arrived they had the worst smell had to wash them multiple times to get them to the point we could even try them. I love Costco, but these don't live up to the brand's standard. "
James,a year ago,3,"About five years ago I purchased sheets from Costco that were terrific. They were heavier than any other set of sheets purchased, and they were soft. They finally wore out. This 800 count are ok but not soft after several washings. I'd love to hear from the Costco buyer. "
DJVancouverUSA,9 months ago,5,"High Quality, heavy weight Well-made corner seams, labels on all sides to let you know whether it’s a top bottom or side, helpful and trying to figure out the direction to put them on, comes with four pillowcases that’s great! High quality, Would recommend them to anyone. "
Elazarus,9 months ago,2,"Overall, decent sheets but much to heavy and definitely not soft.  I think I would have been wise to purchase the sheet set that was a less threads and it may have been lighter and softer.  Very well made so I did not send them back as they were not defective in any way. "
Sallie L,5 months ago,3,"Material is very substantial and silky. Workmanship is TERRIBLE!   No seams were backstitched so they will ravel, I’m expecting.  😩 Lots of uncut threads hanging.  Quality control missed these sheets. Glad I got them on sale! They will go back if they start to unravel! "
Casey T,9 months ago,5,"Great sheets !!! I was a little skeptical from ordering because of the reviews but they are thick and worth every penny. They are definitely soft but yet silky s and they come with four shams would recommend to families and friends, and anyone that needs nice sheets !!! "
Chuck 50,a year ago,5,"Bought the Hotel Signature 800 thread count split king sheets set 2 months ago, glade that we did just ordered another set. Top sheet is much larger than other sheets shown shown for this price as well the fitted sheets, also there are 7 pieces to the split king not 6. "
Emily,9 months ago,5,"Nice heavier weight fabric that is smooth and cool.  I thought the fitted sheets were a little big--I have a sleep number and they don't fit as tight as I had hoped, but finding a nice set for a split king is hard!  Will totally buy these again.  They washed well, too. "
MacMic,9 months ago,5,Soft yet strong describes these sheets. Best I have owned and maybe slept on. I put a microfiber sheet on top of these to protect them from my dog but she pulls the microfiber sheet down to lay on the cotton ones…smart pup. I highly recommend. I bought 2 sets on sale. 
Crazy quilter,a year ago,5,"Great quality and feel to the skin! Bottom sheet hugs the corners and has an overall good fit. Would love to see Costco carry it the warehouse again or at least make it more available for online ordering. I highly recommend this sheet set, best quality for the price!! "
Norm26,9 months ago,2,"Two sets of theses sheets:First observation, bad smell.Washed and most of the bad smell gone.After a couple days use, frayed on top sheet sewing.After a few more days much more fraying. Second set of sheets, exactly the same problems.Will return both sets. "
Jeepstergal,7 months ago,3,"Sheets are good quality, once received. I received an email that they would be late in shipping. They are shipped by third party vendor, not Costco. I needed them by the date specified when ordering, but they were over due. Their communication was not very effecient. "
Phyllis M,a year ago,5,Love these sheets - very luxurious and smooth.  Nice feel to the cotton.  Perhaps a bit on the expensive side but I like that the fitted sheet is not skimpy and that the elastic is sturdy.  There is no struggle to get the sheet over larger mattresses like other sets. 
MER1,a year ago,5,Color (an extraordinary beige) and sheen are fabulous as is the feel of these sheets. They are a little thick. The queen size fit makes it easy to remove and replace the sheets between washings. No wrinkles or shedding either. They make it a pleasure to get into bed. 
Myron,4 months ago,3,Nice sheets but may not fit Cal king bed. Good overall quality and bottom sheet fits fine. But cover sheet is at least two inches short on either side of cal king mattress so it is difficult to make a tidy bed as one side is going to short and not tuck in completely 
Momof3,a year ago,4,"These fit well with elastic on all 4 sides.  They have a tag on each edge saying either side or top/bottom, which makes getting them on the bed easy.  They feel great.  We've only used them for a couple weeks and washed them twice, but so far we are happy with them. "
Gmom2010,9 months ago,5,"I love these sheets! The cloth feel is smooth as butter. I’ve been used to my old top sheets being a bit wrinkly at the top edge. So, I’m pleased to see that the upper edge of this top sheet lays nicely flat over the blanket, as if I’d ironed it that way- I did not. "
DJShadey,a year ago,5,Very nice quality and great price!  I have a California king split very difficult to find sheets and I was so surprised that Costco had them. They are deep pocketed almost too deep for my mattress but I appreciate having them for that price as they are hard to find. 
Peggy,9 months ago,5,These sheets feel very luxurious. Easy to put on and stay on thanks to the elastic all arond the fitted sheet. It's nice that the set includes 4 pillowcases. Wish they sold just pillowcases so I could purchase standard or queen for other pillows. So far very happy. 
Bonnie M,9 months ago,5,"Absolutely love these beautiful sheets. I ordered the king size in white, and they have a wonderful fit at the corners. They are silky smooth and a very nice weight, plus they come out of the dryer with no wrinkles. So happy with them, especially at the sale price. "
Anonymous,8 months ago,5,"My favorite thing about these sheets is that the fitted sheet is labeled so you know which side is for the top/bottom and which sides are for the sides. Why don't ALL sheets do this?? Anyway, they feel great and are substantial in spite of being a high thread count "
RTJ4774,7 days ago,4,The sheets are of excellent quality.  We have bought several sets of sheets from CostCo and they have all been great.  I was a little disappointed the elastic on the fitted sheet was changed.  I like the extra elastic that was on the older ones. 
chrisntony,5 months ago,3,"This is my 3rd set of 800 count sheets.  The first is still fine, the second completely shredded within a year.  I decided to give these one more try.  Read the instructions and noticed they are supposed to be washed on delicate.  Hoping it helps them last longer. "
Reggie,4 days ago,5,Soft and comfortable - washes well - would recommend- this is the second set I have purchased. 
alwayscurious,a year ago,5,"I'm very pleased with these sheets. I bought white ones when they were on sale.  I don't care much for microfiber sheets and wanted cotton.  These are thick, fit deep mattresses, are wrinkle resistant and wash and dry very well. I would definitely buy them again. "
Larry,4 months ago,5,These sheets are very cozy. They are not slick. They are extra long so the sheet folds over blankets and other bedding plus there is plenty for tucking in at the foot of the bed. They could be a bit wider for tucking in on the sides if that is something you want. 
RE guy,10 months ago,5,"I was so happy with these new sheets that I immediately ordered another set. I've tried all sorts of hybrid types like bamboo, bamboo/cotton, permanent/cotton press, but there is not comparison ti these 800 thread count cotton ones. And few wrinkles, too. 5-STARS "
JillT,7 months ago,3,"After purchasing a split king adjustable bed, I purchased the Hotel Signature 800 Thread Count Sheet Set.  These sheets are think and very good quality but I feel they are warm for South Florida.  My next set will be an Egyptian cotton or something a bit cooler. "
Anne K,5 months ago,4,Love the quality of these sheets!  The sateen sheen gives it a luxurious look and feel.  The elastic on the fitted sheet is sturdy.  Only 4 stars though because the fit of the fitted sheet is a big large for my king mattress and the pillowcases are overly large. 
Luigi,a year ago,4,"The 100% cotton fabric is soft and washes well. The fit is very generous to the bed. However, there were loose threads at the end of every sewing line, on sheets and pillow cases, which had to be trimmed. That is a quality control issue and should be addressed. "
Nana in Delray,9 months ago,5,These sheets are an unbelievable value.  They are soft.  They appear to be of the same or better quality than those I’ve bought that are twice the price.  The fitted sheet is roomy enough to make putting it on the bed easy.  I will purchase these sheets again! 
Patty,4 days ago,4,Excellent quality just runs small in length. Love the extra elastic on corners 
Elaine,8 months ago,5,"We got this set of sheets for our new Split California King adjustable bed. I was grateful to have Costco quality in such a rare bed size. The bottom fitted sheets are a tad big, but considering we are moving the mattress all the time, we are not complaining. "
Virgie in Texas,a year ago,3,"This is my third set of the same sheets.  Theses sheets had a terrible smell when they arrived in the container.  Never had I had that smell before.  I had to wash sheets 3 times to remove the smell.  Otherwise, I love this sheets and will probably buy again. "
David,3 months ago,4,"Very nice sheets. The high thread count makes them warm, and I'm a pretty warm sleeper. But they are soft, comfortable. They've been washed once and slept in for a short time so can't comment on their long term quality, but no reason to think they won't last. "
MNH1244,a year ago,3,"These sheets are ok, not very exciting or luxurious. Don’t think I’d buy them again. The material is thick which is fine but doesn’t make them feel more comfortable. So no major complaints but no wins either - nothing to get excited about from my perspective. "
Satisfied,a year ago,5,Nice sheets.  Replaced a set with excessive wrinkling and shirking that turned making the bed into a fight.  (Returned those under a department store's full satisfaction guarantee.)  These have performed well and remain very comfortable after several washes. 
LizzyLou,a year ago,3,"We bought three sets of these sheets in king size.  The white and grey sets are nice, but the ""blue"" sheets are anything but blue - maybe a diluted puke green?  Not sure how anyone would call them blue.  At any rate - nice sheets, be careful about the color. "
CBAZ,8 months ago,5,This product is a perfect quality - price tradeoff point.  We've had guests stay over and ask in the morning where we got the sheets so that they could order a set for their own home.  That's how comfortable they are:  noticeably different from the standard. 
Tamarack Sharon,9 months ago,5,I love them! They fit my pillow top with extra foam pad beautifully.  The fitted queen sheet has a tab stating “side”. And the pillowcase stays in place.  What not to love - the color.   I purchased blue but it’s more a “green” shade and not very attractive. 
Barbk,a year ago,5,"Spent the weekend at one of the nation’s most luxurious hotels and was pleased to find that these CostCo sheets were as nice, or nicer, than those on the hotel beds.  Washes well with few wrinkles and keeps the satiny sheen.  Will definitely purchase again. "
Francee,a year ago,5,"Amazing fabric that is thicker, with a silky feel. Superior quality for an at home brand. Extremely well made with elastic corners that fit our larger, foam king mattress. All  the feels like your sleeping at a 5star resort! Beautiful after several washing! "
Danielle,9 months ago,4,"I love this brand of sheets. Deep corner pockets. The sheen of the material fades after like 2-3 washes. The downside is the quality isn’t as great as they were 4 years ago. If you even so much as snag these sheets, they’re done and tear almost like muslin. "
Peter,9 months ago,5,"This is one of the few sheet sets which provides 4 pillow cases. Otherwise, with only 2 cases, you have to purchase a mismatched set. The sheets are made from sturdy fabric, yet still very soft. We ended up buying a second set because we loved them so much. "
Fontno1,4 months ago,1,"I had to return item. There was 4 cal king pillow covers and cal king flat sheet. However the fitted sheet was not a split cal king and was very small, the size of a queen fitted. I have not opened the other one yet, but will return if incorrectly packaged. "
J Reynerson,a year ago,3,"Itchy sheets! I have another Kirkland hotel collection set that is great but starting to look shabby so I bought this to replace them, overall not pleased and sending back. These are sateen and sort of slip all over and dont stay fitted in place on the bed. "
Unhappy customer,3 months ago,4,"Love the feel of these sheets, very luxurious!  We have a split Cal-King and the bottom sheets are soo lose.  Wish they had wide elastic at the corners which I could sew on if I had a sewing machine.  They do wash & dry very well with very little wrinkles. "
Tami,a year ago,3,"I absolutely love the way these sheets feel. So comfy, however, we had to order another set because the fitted sheet ripped. Had the 2nd set only 1 week and while making the bed I noticed a tear in the corner at the foot of the bed so I returned both sets. "
Jill J,9 months ago,4,"These are very nice sheets. Good quality. If your mattress is higher than 16 inches, mine is 17 1/2 inches, the flat sheet will barely come down to the bottom of the mattress. The top sheet could use 4 more inches in the width. Fitted sheet fits perfectly. "
SamGeb,4 months ago,1,"Bought these white sheets to wash and sanitize using hot water and Chlorine (as customery with Hotel bed-sheets). Washing instructions dictate Warm Wash, no Chorine. Afraid that these sheets would shrink if washed in hot water. Had to return them unopened. "
Georgia,a year ago,2,"I’m sorry to report these sheets are not at all the quality of a 650 thread count set of sheets we purchased over a year ago from Costco, even though they appear to be the same.  It’s as though you switched quality to a poor substitute and didn’t tell us. "
Andreas,9 months ago,5,"These are the absolute best best sheets Costco has ever sold!  I've used both the Kirkland and Charisma sheets and while they're great for the money, the Hotel Signature 800 Count are a couple levels up.  I truly hope Costco continues to carry this brand. "
omal412,7 months ago,5,"I have purchased these sheets several times and given to family as gifts.  Once you have slept on these soft, thick sheets you will never go back.  You find them only online these days. Do not make the mistake of buying the 600 thread count in the store! "
Lisa,4 months ago,4,Love the sheets. They fit nicely. Bottom sheet is slightly large but has nice pocket reinforcements I use to get these sheets from another provider and they were 800 Egyptian cotton. Slightly softer and better fitted  that is why I did not give a 5 star 
SherR,11 months ago,4,"Had high hopes for these sheets. I washed them 1st, but the first night I slept on them they were so scratchy I had to change out the pillow slips to one of my old ones. I washed them again , and they feel better. Hoping subsequent washes will help more. "
Goldilox,3 months ago,3,I returned the 600 thread count because it was too scratchy.These are so thick. I'm hoping with a few washes these will soften up without the need for chemical softeners. Why are the sheets inside of the very nice case that they come in not as soft? 
Sunset SF Retirees,9 months ago,5,"These bed sheet sets are the best quality - very smooth, fine and luxurious feeling to touch. I love sleeping on these sheets. I immediately changed my two beds. Now that have an extra set for each bed, I can't be more happier to get a good night sleep. "
Massjayhawk,3 months ago,4,The sheets feel nice and wash well. Did not notice any off smells. Was disappointed that after the first wash there were many loose threads that had to be snipped around the edges- sheets were not finished well. After that clean up. They have been fine. 
Brian Legare,a year ago,5,"Finally, sheets that are amazingly comfortable, long enough to stay tucked in with a thick mattress, and no pilling. I expect these to last awhile. Like them so much I bought a second set. The bottom sheet is so good I no longer need to use sheet belts. "
Sleeping Great,2 months ago,5,"These sheets are very comfortable and you can feel the quality of the material. Always at a great price and when on sale a truly exceptional deal. I’ve purchased more expensive sheets, but these are by far the best value for sheets I’ve ever purchased. "
BevP,a year ago,5,"Love the sheets! Have a nice feel to them. They wash beautifully.  I got them on sale and they were a great price. Am using in a guest room n I have received nice compliments about how nice they felt. Will definitely buy more, hoping for another sale!! "
KJ28,4 months ago,2,"Bought this when we changed out our mattress. The sheets are very thick, stiff, and nonbreathable. Even after multiple washes, they feel like weatherproofed tarp. We can't return them, so they'll be the backup, backup sheets that we pray we never need. "
lcbd27,a year ago,5,"We were concerned before we purchased these because our bed has a thick pillow top mattress, but these sheets are not skimpy, there is plenty of material to tuck in.  They are made of quality material and have a great feel.  Glad we made the purchase! "
Ann Broadaway,11 months ago,5,Love these sheets!  They are soft yet sturdy. They look like high quality sheets. My guests think they’re amazing.  Come out of washer/dryer looking great. I did iron the pillow covers just to give them a super finished look.  Proof?  I bought 6 sets! 
Steve L,a year ago,4,We are very happy with the quality of these sheets and would recommend them to anyone. They appear to be well made and the fabric is very soft. We have tried other sheet sets from various vendors on Amazon and these are much better and worth the cost. 
Unhappy Dave,a year ago,5,"We've been disappointed in the previous half-dozen sets we've purchased elsewhere ... now we found these.  Great quality cotton, neither too hot or cold, and plenty large for our split-king.  We will buy an extra set and additional for other bedrooms. "
Sueb,a year ago,5,"Have only been using the sheets for a week so can’t comment on how long they will last. They fit well and feel great. Appear to be high quality.   They smell horrible when you open them but once washed, all the odor is gone. Good sheets for the price. "
Longtime Costco Member,5 months ago,3,"I ordered 3 sheet sets, 1ea. In white, gray and dark blue. Instead Costco shipped 1 gray and 2 white sets. The items were only available online leaving members with no in-store access. Not the first time an on-line Costco order is incorrectly filled. "
Lisa S,4 months ago,3,"Nice sheets, but….the finish work on them is awful.  The sheets themselves are substantial with a lovely, smooth feel but the hems are fraying and shedding threads all over my laundry and the bedroom.  I expect a better finish on high quality sheets. "
irene69,a year ago,3,Hotel Signature 800 Thread Count 6-Piece Sheet Set is nice but I don't feel they qualify for the higher price when compared to the 680 Thread Count Kirkland 6-Piece Sheet Set.  I will be sticking with the Kirkland Brand since they are a better price. 
Betty,a year ago,5,"The most comfortable sheets I've ever owned! So soft, plus they stay put so I don't have to readjust it all the time. Also love how there's a tag on the inside that tells you which side is top/bottom, making it quicker to actually get it on your bed. "
GaryJ,5 months ago,5,"You can't beat the quality and the price was ultra low when it comes to quality sheets. I bought two sets, one for my king and one for the guest bedroom, Queen. I'm extremely happy with my purchase and would recommend to definitely give these a try. "
TradCatMom,a month ago,5,These are the best cotton sheets! They are soft and comfortable. There is no wrinkling out of the dryer. I don’t even want to put my old set of favorite sheets on now! I ordered the blue and the color is true to the picture- soft and muted yet rich. 
Shoto,11 months ago,3,"I purchased this item because of a good experience with the previous iteration of it. However, the current version does not compare in terms of quality. Same specs, lesser quality suggests a problem with sourcing/quality control. Correct it, please. "
Parson9,a year ago,5,Just fantastic. Love the labels assisting in selecting the correct side. Feel is wonderful. Will purchase more! One caveat…sheet packaging smelled horrible. A quick wash did the trick but the squeamish stomach may have difficulty getting that far😁 
Little Red Jeep,a year ago,4,Great sheets.  I have ordered them before and will most definitely order again.  Long staple Cotten are the best and the bonus is EXTRA pillowcases. Launder great with few if any wrinkles.  Great product at a good price.  Keep them in stock Costco! 
L LaR,9 months ago,5,"These are the best sheets ever! I've paid much more for sheets and the quality wasn't nearly as good as these sheets. They feel wonderful, launder easily, and last a very long time. Plus the double elastic corners really keep the sheets tucked in. "
Xxxx,4 months ago,3,"I was disappointed to learn that the sheets were not satin. I haven’t opened them yet. They’re nice sheets, but it’s not what I was looking for. If you have the 800 count hotel sheets That are satin Or 100 % percale, Please let me know. Thank you. "
Vitola,a year ago,3,"These sheets seem to be of good quality, but the chemical smell is very strong and unpleasant. I had to wash and dry these sheets several times. Was very hesitant about them and thought about returning them. I’m still not sure if I’m keeping them. "
J clark,4 months ago,4,"These sheets are very comfortable, just what I had hoped.  They wash and dry well without much wrinkling.  They fit my very deep mattress. I’ve washed them several times and have noticed some minor fraying along one edge.  I would purchase again. "
DLB1965,8 months ago,5,"These sheets are very comfortable, wash well and they fit our deep mattress.  I followed the instructions drying on low and so far no shrinkage.  Shrinkage has been a problem with other sheets but not this set.  Very happy they were on sale, too. "
Krch,3 months ago,3,"The material is really nice and doesn't wrinkle much; however, the queen is about 12""-14"" too wide, and one pillowcase isn't properly stitched.  I am considering turning them in for a refund.  Also beware that the ""beige"" is really a light gray. "
C ca,3 months ago,2,"Sadly, the sheets were not what I expected. I have a California king bed ordered California king sheets and the top sheet was way too short from bottom to top can’t tuck in the bottom. It’s about 10 inches too short. Width is fine length is not. "
Matt P,5 months ago,2,"Unfortunately the fitted sheet developed a small hole upon washing them per the instructions, and before we even had a chance to lay on them. They look decent enough but it’s hard to trust the QC and we’ll be returning and trying something else. "
ArleneinPismo,9 months ago,5,Replaced a set of well worn 600 TC Costco sheets with these and can feel the difference. Heavier and softer to touch. Washed and put to use immediately. i don’t normally iron sheets but I ironed the pillow cases to get the ‘hotel’ look and feel. 
Jenn O,9 months ago,4,I bought these years ago. I LOVED them and having been waiting for months to them to go on sale so when they did I grabbed another set.  They don't seem to be made the way they used to so that's disappointing but they are still a good sheet set. 
J Green,a year ago,5,"Perfect weight, softness and color. I had a 650 thread count set with more detailing on the pillow cases and sheet hems, but the feel of these are far superior. This set comes with 4 pillow cases! I purchased a second set in a different color. "
Marshall,a year ago,5,The sheets are wonderful and I love the feel and color. My only qualm is the set contains four king size pillow cases and ordinarily I would utilize two of the king sizes but would prefer a smaller size for the two additional pillow case sizes. 
Jtrotman,9 months ago,5,I have ordered these before and the quality is amazing and I have washed them several times and the final results look like new.  Highly recommend.  I have noticed with this last order the flat sheet could be wider to fully cover the mattress. 
BKSB,7 months ago,3,Unfortunately the sheets were too heavy for us. We had no idea they would weigh so much. We do not have strong backs and couldn't image having to make the bed with them or moving them when damp from the washer into the dryer. We returned them. 
Arthur,2 months ago,5,"These are the first set of sheets we've ever purchased that felt wonderful and worth more than we paid for them.  The pillow cases are over-sized for our pillows and the material just feels luxurious, and we wish we'd have bought more of them. "
Rsbm,4 months ago,4,"Great strong, yet soft fabric feel. So helpful on king size to have tags that state side or top/bottom. Easy to fit bottom sheet. Only negative is bottom sheet doesn’t tuck under on sides. Has to be pushed in which is a bit hard on one’s back. "
Joyfull,9 months ago,5,"Very soft, and the colors were perfect… The blue is more of a dusty blue than a bright blue, which I liked. The sheets were well-made and fabric was good quality. My only complaint was that the Cal king flat sheet was about 5 inches too long! "
Lavoila,9 months ago,2,The sheets are very heavy and not particularly soft.  Years ago costco sheets were the absolute best. They were 100%pima cotton and were silky and soft. All mine have worn out. Keep hoping they’ll rediscover those.  I’m disappointed in these. 
boges55,8 months ago,5,"I originally bought these for my rental unit, but they are such good quality, I use them myself now too. They withstand my cats’ claws well too. Costco does not sell them in the stores, so I buy a couple sets each time they go on sale online. "
Susie,8 months ago,5,"After several weeks of use I can say I really like these sheets. They don’t seem to wrinkle as much as other sheets after washing.  Very soft, and feels good next to your body.  I will be purchasing another set the next time they are on sale. "
Jeff in VA,8 months ago,5,"These are thick, silky smooth sheets that are a real bargain at this price. We needed split king sheets, which are hard to find. Costco sells them with 4 pillowcases. They wash nicely and are very comfortable. Will definitely buy another set. "
sunshinebml,5 months ago,3,I had high hopes for these sheets but I returned them. After the first wash there were loose threads everywhere as well as some seams not sewn straight. Fabric seemed nice but never slept in them so I cannot comment on if they are breathable. 
JohninSanFrancisco,a year ago,5,"These are amazing quality and a great value. Costco comes through on this amazing set of sheets. Even the sides are labeled for easy bed making. The packaging did have an odd smell but that did not impact the sheets and once washed, all good. "
DoesntLike2Cook,9 months ago,3,"We've had these sheets for many years. They hold up well, but get wrinkled and stay that way. I gave up ironing early in our marriage (about 55 years ago). I noticed I was using the same set day in and day out. This new set is my back-up set. "
IHudson,4 months ago,4,I ordered off the website hoping for a robin’s egg blue but it’s more a silvery pale blue so I decided to keep them! They are very lush with a silky feel but also substantial in weight/thickness so should hold up to years of use and washings. 
Williams,a year ago,5,Only used for a couple of weeks but washed nicely to a soft finish.   Plenty of coverage for our 5 year old mattress. A bit heavier than our prior Kirkland sheets but we like it for winter.  Will have to see how it feels in the warmer months. 
audubon Jon,3 months ago,5,"These hotel sheets are great and the fabric is very substantial, which we like.   Most of these sheets are very thin and don't last.   I would recommend these very highly.   You certainly can beat the price for these split king hotel sheets. "
Erik,6 months ago,5,Heck yes 
Squirrel,a year ago,5,There is nothing like sleeping on 800 thread count sheets. Costco's price when offering the discount makes this purchase an easy choice.I ordered the crisp white sheets and I am very pleased with the high quality and price of the product. 
Andrea Rossi,a year ago,5,without a doubt the best sheets I have ever slept on and at an excellent price. They clean up beautifully with the top sheet not rolling at the edges and and the decorative edges of the top sheet and the pillow cases not creasing. well done 
KeepTheDollarFiftyHotdog,2 months ago,4,"I was ready to spend double for high quality, soft sheets. My friend suggested I try these and I'm glad I did. Even if the more expensive sheets are softer, they aren't enough to pay the extra amount (and I'm not sure they ever are anyway). "
Lisa A,4 months ago,5,The quality of these sheets is top-notch! This is our second set. We purchased the sizes queen and full. The deep pocket stretch fits well over our mattress topper without pulling or coming loose. The softness keeps me coming back for more! 
Nina,a month ago,5,"These sheets are spectacular! They feel amazing, as they are thick and luxurious. The fitted sheet is roomy enough to fit my very deep queen size mattress. I bought the same set several years ago and loved the quality and the feel so much. "
Ballard,a year ago,5,"Softest and best sheets I’ve ever own. Very high quality. My last set of hotel 800 tc sheets were great but not nearly as soft as these. I have always purchased my sheets from Costco and will continue. Trust me, you will love them as well. "
Heather2000,4 months ago,5,"Really nice quality, very soft and comfortable & a great value, too.  The sheets wash very well and I really like the generous elastic corners that make it easier to make the bed.  I highly recommend these and I’m buying my next set today! "
Leah,a year ago,4,Well made and comfortable.  I gave 4 stars because I have a regular depth split king and the fitted sheets are too big. They are very baggy.  If you have a taller mattress you will love them. I have to keep tucking them under every morning 
Denny,3 months ago,5,We always bought Biltmore Hotel sheets until the quality just plummeted.  The quality of these Hotel Signature 800 thread count sheets from Costco is every bit as fine as that of the original Biltmore sheets.  I just ordered two more sets… 
GimpyOldLady,3 months ago,5,I recently purchased these sheets in dark blue which weren’t as dark as I expected but they are a beautiful rich color. The fabric is heavier than others I’ve had and they wash well and come out with few wrinkles. I’m very happy with them. 
SLinSoCal,9 months ago,5,"Excellent quality 100% high thread count sheets. Deep well made fitted pockets. Remain soft and smooth after repeated washings. Smooth finish but not an over sateen slippery feel. Although pricier than other choices, well worth the price. "
Harry,8 months ago,5,"This a very high-quality sheet set.  Smooth, cool and comfortable.  Although it is too early to tell, I've gotten the impression these are durable.  The blue is a very relaxing hue.  I look forward to getting between them when I see them. "
Amanda,4 months ago,2,Comfortable sheets once they are washed and used. They were a little stiff at first. Issue with them is after a month the fitted sheet already has thread fraying. For the price feel that’s way too early for fabric to fray. Plan to return. 
Bo Woz,9 months ago,5,"I really like these sheets. Only wash them once, Put them on the bed, and slept on them for a week.They feel better the I thought they would.They seem to be great sheets. I really can't say anything bad about them. Highly recommend them. "
TrekNapa,9 months ago,4,"I like that 4-pillow cases were included.  The sheets are great for thick mattresses.   I have another set of Hotel sheets not sure which model, but prefer those sheets to these - I prefer the feel of my other set.  These are good though. "
SissyN,a year ago,3,"I prefer cool, smooth sheets. These are not my favorites. The bamboo Costco sold years have are five star cool and smooth.  I have used one set almost daily for 10+ years and they still look brand new. These are a bit rough to the touch. "
H in ABQ,8 months ago,5,"These sheets are of excellent quality, by which I mean the weight and feel of the fabric, the depth of the lower sheet and the size of the upper sheet. All these are a cut above lesser quality sheets. I'm very pleased with this purchase. "
Jenn,9 months ago,5,"I love these sheets.  They are strong, yet soft.  They stay cool throughout the night.  I've used them for years, but it was time to replace the old ones after about 10 years.  Very durable and last a long time even with weekly washings. "
Katy Lady,8 months ago,2,"The fitted sheet was supposed to work with mattresses on an adjustable frame, but they don't. When I  raise the head of the bed, through the night, the corners lift up and off.  When I bought these same sheets a year ago, they stayed on. "
George,8 months ago,4,Our new mattress has 18” drop so your sheets just fit to bottom by less than ½ inch. If you would make them to go underneath the mattress by 3” I would give you 5-stars and tell you how wonderful the corners are made. Very comfortable!!! 
David,9 months ago,5,"These sheets really are quite nice. They were much more than I would normally spend on sheets, but definitely worth it. They are cool and comfortable, and I've slept noticeably better. After these, I don't think I can go back. Try them! "
Hue G,4 months ago,5,"These sheets are one of my favorite sheet sets.  I like that it comes with 4 pillow cases, the flat sheet is longer than most. The set is very soft and thick.  I will buy more when my lesser sheets wear out, if they are still available. "
Boulder1,a year ago,5,"I have been waiting for these to be in stock and on sale. They are replacing my Kirkland sheets, which are just not wide enough for a queen bed. The Hotel brand is much more generous with its sizing and fit my queen mattress very well. "
P Brown,a year ago,5,The fabric quality is very impressive. I have not actually used the sheets yet as I am still using flannel sheets for cooler temps. I have laundered the sheets and I am very pleased with the fabric. Can't wait to sleep on these sheets. 
Tico,7 months ago,5,I've been using Kirkland Hotel Signature 800 thread count sheets for years and I truly love them. They are very cool a d soft to the touch. I would like the option of purchasing extra pillow cases though. I'm very happy with my sheets. 
TeresaBee,10 months ago,5,"These sheets are beyond luxurious. Best sheets I’ve ever purchased.  I appreciate they are offered in Split California King. I have purchased two sets, I plan to purchase two more. I have already recommended them to family and friends. "
Dee L,a year ago,5,"These sheets are exactly what I was looking for. They are so soft, comfortable and fit my queen bed perfectly. They smelled bad when I took them out of the packaging. I washed them and the smell was completely gone. Love these sheets! "
Mike,3 months ago,4,Sheets are comfortable. The top and side tags on the fitted sheets are helpful when making a king bed. There were a lot of loose threads so I was a little concerned about durability but the are holding up fine after several washings. 
HBDave,11 months ago,5,"We love these sheets! They feel like 5-star hotel sheets!  I appreciate the deep pockets since we have a really thick mattress. Even better, they don’t shrink like every other set of sheets we’ve had.  Wash well, look and feel great! "
FLshopper,2 months ago,5,"I am so happy to find these sheets on the Costco website. We have a split California king bed and finding sheets that stay on in the corners has been a challenge. These ones are perfect! Also, very soft and smooth. I am very pleased! "
Comfy sleeper,a year ago,5,"We bought trendy, super expensive sheets thinking they’d be our favorites. We sent them back and ordered these when we slept at an Airbnb and fell in love with them. They are our favorite sheets! Crisp, clean, and comfy, all around. "
msmorality,4 months ago,5,"These are the only sheets i purchase.  And only from Costco.  Unfortunately our local Costco didn't carry them.  They only had 680 thread count so i had to buy from Costco online.  Quick delivery.  And, the sheets last a long time. "
Alice,a year ago,5,"These sheet sets are such a great buy for the money. They are thick but comfortable, they come out of the washer/dryer looking so good and fit the bed very well. I love the label for top/bottom. I just wish they sold twin size set. "
saltwaterdiva,9 months ago,3,I didn't even bother to unpack these. There are four pillowcases in a queen size sheet set but they are all for queen size pillows and too large for a standard. I don't need six inches hanging off the end of my pillowcase at night. 
Elizabeth,9 months ago,5,"Best sheets ever! They stay in place, they r soft yet sturdy, they have sewed into the elastic a tab that tells you which is top, bottom or sides for better fit on the fitted sheet & they wash beautifully.This is my second pair! "
Rachel,9 months ago,4,"The sheets are a good length and the weight is very comfortable. Found that the pillowcases were not finished properly; a lot of long threads sticking out of the seam/pillowcase. Otherwise, the set was a good value for the price. "
Joyce Ann,a year ago,5,Great fabric.  So easy to put on.  Corners fit great and the top/bottom and side tabs are a brilliant addition.  Also love the 6 piece set that provides 2 additional pillow cases.  Would purchase again and again and in fact have! 
PegCart,3 months ago,5,"I love them!  So crisp and smooth.  Washed up really well and feel just as good as new. Great corners and well marked so you know which end is bottom/top. Wish I'd discovered these sooner.  Only wish they were more ""white"" white. "
Anonymous,8 months ago,2,"With such a high thread count, I expect it is soft silky sheet. The quality was great however, the sheets surface was not silky but rather a little stiff and almost scratchy. I am very particular about having silky smooth sheets. "
Anne Marie,4 months ago,5,"I love these sheets! This is our third set of these sheets. They are so comfy and soft, get better with each wash. They hold up, and are a great fit on our king mattress. Shipping took a little longer than expected, but worth it! "
LoriD,4 months ago,5,"These sheets are great! They are thick with a silky feel. They wash up very nicely and the color didn’t fade at all. We’ve only been sleeping on them for a week, but so far they are wonderful. I would definitely recommend these. "
wesinpinehurst,5 months ago,5,I’ve bought these sheets for years. They’re pure luxury. Everyone’s a skeptic until they try them. You will find higher thread counts but not better quality. Don’t understand why these aren’t always available. Buy while you csn. 
outofmadison,4 months ago,5,Just received them yesterday - they washed well with minimal wrinkling when I took them out of the dryer.  They are heavy substantial sheets and will fit deep mattresses.   I am considering another set if they go on sale again. 
Jane,4 months ago,5,"Love these sheets!  I have so much trouble finding soft sheets, but these were soft from the first day I used them.  Also have trouble finding sheets with deep pockets to fit our pillowtop mattress, but these are a perfect fit! "
freeascanbe,9 months ago,5,Very pleased. The fitted sheet has elastic all the way around and made it the easiest bed I have ever made.  I am disabled so it was a very nice surprised how easy it was for me to make it.  Am thinking about another purchase. 
CC Cotton,11 months ago,3,Stitching loosely done as edges look and feel hasty done in some places isn’t even flatly stitched- rolled and pulled with long thread hanging Fabric is quality -crisp and breathable but hard to get past stitching on corners 
User,2 months ago,5,"Although the Hotel Signature 880 Thread Count 6-Piece Sheet Set has yet to used, the seam finish is excellent, the fabric has a luxurious feel and the sheet size appears that it will fit mattresses of 12 inches or more thick. "
Anita M,a month ago,5,We bought a queen set in dark blue and couldn't be happier with the purchase. The sheets are so very soft and luxurious and the finishing of each piece is excellent. I love that Costco offers sheet sets with four pillowcases. 
SanDiego Girl,a year ago,5,I love these sheets! They look beautiful on my bed. They actually look more silver than gray and have a beautiful sheen to them. They feel very sturdy and well made. I would like to buy another set when they go on sale again. 
100 percent cotton lover,4 months ago,5,These sheets washed up really nice and are an easy fold. I ordered in gray and they are true to color and cannot see through them due the thread count. They come with a envelope holding bag so easily fit in your linen closet. 
Diana,a year ago,2,"I washed these sheets 6 times and they still irritate my skin after laying on them for a few minutes.  They feel soft to the touch, but hard to sleep on.  I do have sensitive skin and am going to wash them several more times. "
SuziK,a year ago,5,These are very soft and luxurious for sheets of this thread count. They wash and dry beautifully. The fitted sheet has such deep pockets with stretch so they're easy to put on our very high mattress with an added foam topper! 
Franco,3 months ago,5,These are very high quality sheets. We ordered two king sets in different colors and for some reason the flat sheet in one of them is not as wide as the other. It's like said set came with a queen flat sheet instead of king. 
AmyATX,10 months ago,5,Best sheets ever! Better than more expensive luxury sheets and they wash and wear great over time. Highly recommend the investment. These are the second set I’ve purchased after being disappointed by two other luxury brands. 
Janet,4 months ago,5,"It has a heavier feeling with 800 thread count.  Feels nice and washes up great.  Plenty of room to tuck in fitted sheet. I love it. And every side of fitted sheet says either ""top or bottom' or ""side"" which is a great help. "
pianoguy,4 months ago,5,"These are the nicest quality sheets I've ever purchased.  Very dense and soft. Love them.  The pillow cases are a bit large (perhaps because it's Cal King), but better too large than too small.  Very happy with these sheets. "
Shellcomment,7 months ago,5,These are the best sheets ever. They have adequate size to fit my mattress and stay tucked all night long. They wash well and last for years. Yes a bit pricier than some but they last longer.  You won’t regret your purchase. 
Frank,9 months ago,5,Great Product as a perfect fit for our Cal-King mattress.  Durable material with the 800 thread count and very well tailored with sewn elastic & corners.  Good feature that fitted bottom sheet is labeled for top and bottom. 
Harrison,4 months ago,3,"Costco quality continues to fall, and my loyalty, with it. The sheets are just ok, our previous sheets from Costco were fantastic right out of the box. These feel course and we will need hundreds of washes to reach comfort. "
DeeDeeFl,4 months ago,5,Beautiful gray sheets and pillow cases. Wash up nicely following directions. Very comfortable to sleep on. Easy to put on bed with elastic corners. I liked them so much I ordered another set of them for a different bedroom. 
Cuartlinds,4 months ago,2,These are not as soft as I had hoped they would be - in fact the pillowcases are too rough for my face. However my biggest complaint is that the king size does not seem wide enough for my bed. I definitely do not recommend. 
Robert O,a year ago,5,Loved the sheets from the moment I opened them. The sheets have a wonderful feel to them and they appear to be strong and durable with a soft silk texture. Fit was excellent and I am sure I will get many years out of them. 
L Zhang,4 months ago,5,"I love this products, I first time order two ,one  grey color and one beige color, I use it after washing a few days feel so good , soft and warm high quality no wrinkle yes right  second time order  one more white color , "
Gammie 6,4 months ago,5,I absolutely love these sheets. They are some of the best sheets I’ve ever bought. The fabric is substantial. There’s a crispness to them but they are not stiff. With every wash they get softer. A luxurious set of sheets!! 
Patti ledbetter,4 months ago,5,These sheets are amazing. They’re smooth and keep my body temp cool. They fit my king size bed great with the deep corner pockets. The stitching is very well done. These are the sheets on which all other sheets are judged. 
David D,a year ago,5,"Full size sheets actually fit the mattress and the pillow cases are real, not sham cases like other brands.  Plus, 4 of them.  Fabric is on grain and irons nicely.  Very happy.  Wish they had softer colors for my next set. "
Cheryl,3 months ago,4,These sheets were pretty soft after being washed and dried once. I knocked off a star because I use hydrocortisone ointment at night on my hands for eczema and it doesn't wash out so it leaves greasy stains on the sheets. 
Wheelsrk,10 months ago,5,"Purchase first set for our split King bed.  We like them so much we than ordered 2 Queen Sets.  High quality material that feels very soft, and the sheets fit the beds very well.  Excellent purchase for price and quality! "
sbabettes,3 months ago,3,I have purchased these sheets in the past and was very pleased with the quality.  The last set I purchased is not of the same quality.  The pillowcases are sewn uneven. The edges do not match up. I will be returning them! 
Sleepytimegal,11 months ago,5,"High quality look and feel.  I like a bit of crispness to my sheets and these fill the bill.  They have an attractive sheen and feel good.   I thought the price was a bit high, but after use, thought these were worth it. "
Parksie,3 months ago,4,"I love these sheets! That being said, I have had them in the past and they do seem to tear before the time it should be to wear out. (Less than a year). Otherwise, I would give it 5 stars. Hoping these will be different. "
Carrie,3 months ago,2,I have a California King bed and the top sheet is not sized properly.  The width is too short to cover the sides of the mattress and the length is way too long.  The are not the softest sheets so they will be going back. 
Dana,a month ago,5,Excellent quality. Great cotton feel with dense weave. They wash and dry well and go on easily. We recently bought a split king and changing the linens is a challenge but these work as easily as any could be expected to. 
Atlas1,a year ago,4,"I love these sheets, I would have given them 5 stars but they are not as wide as I would like. I ordered California King size because they are longer.  Six to eight more inches would be nice in width. The fabric is nice. "
BD_CostcoShopper,11 months ago,5,"This is the 3rd set I have ordered these sheets. I have them for every bed in the house. And, I am planning on ordering another set. They are soft and sturdy enough for multiple washes. They don't seem to wrinkle either. "
Deb R,a year ago,5,"Purchased Split Cal King Set in white.  Meets all of our expectations, comfortable feel, generous fit, sewn well, wide elastic on bottom sheets, corners seamed with elastic, washes well.  Great value, we are very happy. "
SBMo,8 months ago,5,"Very high quality sheets! I’ve bought 5 sets so I have a few back ups for different beds and different colors. These wash well, are very soft and look great! Wish they had more color options and went on sale more often! "
Caligirlintexas,a year ago,3,We missed them terribly! The quality of the fabric is not the same or is the sewing. They already have loose strings after a couple of washings. The fabric is like night and day compared to the last time I bought these. 
Dabred,4 months ago,5,These sheets are very nice. They have some body to the fabric which I like. So many sheets you buy are very flimsy and clingy. Would definitely buy again. It would be nice if sheet sets were a little wider on the sides. 
Ditto,a year ago,4,"I really like these sheets, they are wide enough for my King size bed, including the pillow cases.  The only complaint I have is that they do wrinkle somewhat, but not enough to bother me.  I would definitely buy again. "
Eliz,8 months ago,5,"Excellent quality. The size, California King is a little too long for regular Split King bed.  Unfortunately, this size was not available.   Hope Costco will make the King Split bed size available for their sheet sets. "
bluebird,9 months ago,5,I have bought these sheets many times and love the way they feel and especially love  the quality.  The one I got this time seem to be a little larger. The fitted and the flat sheet are bigger.  So that is another plus 
Susi,9 months ago,4,"These sheets are worth buying. The sizing is perfect! The texture is wonderful! The only drawback is the drab colors. I myself prefer bright color, or at least something without a gray tone - beige tends to look dirty. "
Big Al in MT,4 months ago,5,Actually bought these for my spare bedroom as I am a sheet snob and only sleep on certain sheets at my house. But these actually were surprisingly very soft and feel amazing. I will be buying more for my master suite. 
Canyondoggy,9 months ago,5,"I bought myself these 2 years ago. They are indeed hotel quality. Thicker than your everyday. So I just got another set. Very generous elastic, easy to put on. No pilling!!! Luxury for a fraction of the cost of others "
Daktam,9 months ago,5,"Very good quality, lovely, comfortable, and wrinkle resistant sheets.  They're a bit large for our king size bed (but will fit if/when we get a pillow-top version), and can be pulled tight so that they still fit well. "
CLNrn,3 months ago,5,"I am a sheet snob. I love soft silky sheets and for many years I have bought high end sheets. These are the best sheets I have ever owned!  They are soft, a nice weight and have a beautiful sheen. I highly recommend! "
Linda R,4 months ago,5,These sheets are heavy weight sateen cotton. Very soft and comfortable. I’ve washed them several times since purchasing. They come out of the dryer almost wrinkle free. Will purchase another set in a different color. 
Teresa R,a month ago,5,"Wonderful sheets! Arrived on time, have a wonderfully smooth feel, and the corners of the fitted sheet are easy to put on and really STAY ON ! Much nicer than most hotels we have stayed in. Great value for the price. "
Happysleeper,7 months ago,5,"So many times you might order high count thread count, and they are so thin but not these  These sheets are so silky, smooth and you can never go wrong with the thread count for sheets. I’ve had in a very long time. "
Nancy W,10 months ago,5,"I like these sheets although I have only used them one. I like the pockets, they are gathered so I think they will stay on well. The best part was it came with two fitted sheets. That is always what rips, eventually. "
Robin R,4 months ago,5,I love these sheets! They have a great weight but are smooth and soft and wash wonderfully. They are almost wrinkle proof but I still press the pillowcases but that’s just me. I will definitely purchase these again! 
FranE,10 months ago,5,"Excellent sheets for the money. Thick, soft, silky, with a nice sheen. All cotton sheets are going to wrinkle, but these don't wrinkle too badly. I don't think you'll find nicer sheets anywhere, regardless of price. "
Char,a month ago,5,"I love these bed sheets! I bought a king set 6 months ago and I like them so much I just bought a second set of these sheets. They are good quality, well made, 100% cotton, feel great to sleep on and don't wrinkle. "
Debi in Toledo OH,9 months ago,2,"Thought 800 threadcount would make fir soft sheets, but after washing & drying, they are still  'crisp' & wrinkle a fair amount right from the dryer. Will wash a couple more times befor I return them. Disappointed. "
Susan,9 months ago,5,These sheets fit my deep mattress and I love the elastic on the side instead of the ends. The bed is easier for me to make and they also tag the top or bottom. And they are soft and substantial. Absolutely 5 stars. 
RondaM,a year ago,5,Ordered these as our last ones had gotten so thin.  The fabric is very thick.  Love how it’s tagged with side or top/bottom so easy when making the bed.  We have a split king.  So far very happy with these sheets. 
RHN1,a year ago,5,I have just received the shipment and I noticed that the color is not the same shade as the website. The sheets seem to be be well made so I will likely keep them. I will update this comment once I have used them. 
JoeS,a year ago,5,"The quality of these sheets is outstanding. There were some unclipped threads on some of the sheets, but I wouldn’t no way call that poor quality. They have held up really well and have exceptionally strong seams. "
Monica,9 months ago,5,"So far these sheets are high quality in our standards. We thought there was not much difference between a 680 and 800 Thread count, but after seeing, feeling and sleeping on them the difference there is much more. "
Bert,4 months ago,4,These are a bit different from previous purchase - larger which is good. The fit for the bottom sheet is more generous therefore doesn’t stay tightly fitted which is annoying to me. Color (light blue) is gorgeous. 
Debra,9 months ago,5,These sheets are worth every cent! I am so impressed with the quality of these sheets I bought another set. They are soft and thick. They fit my king size bed better than my $200.00 sheets and are better quality. 
Pamela,8 months ago,5,"Love! Love! Love! These sheets. They will be the only sheets I buy from now on. They are smooth to touch, not hot, and fit nicely over my thick mattress topper without bunching or coming off after being slept on. "
red dogs and more,a year ago,5,"Great sheets @ the best price in town.  Soft and confortable from the first wash but get even better with age and more washes.  And they last well -- no rips, tears or pilling. They are the only sheets I buy now. "
Stargirl1,a year ago,4,Nice deep sheets but a little stiff suprisingly. I think the Costco brand which is crisp but giving might be a little better. But for a deep sheet these are it!!  Not coming off the corners and nice feel overall 
MWildd,a year ago,5,"Finally- a real ""Hotel type"" sheet sets that doesn't cost an arm & a leg! Good medium weight, soft and deep pockets on the fitted sheet. Bonus- comes with two sets of standard pillow cases on the queen size set. "
Wendy,5 months ago,5,These are the nicest sheets we’ve owned. The weight and feel is very luxurious and they didn’t get all weird after washing. We even feel like we sleep better at night.We will definitely be getting a second set! 
Csr6579,9 months ago,5,"Butter soft and good mattress coverage! These sheets are better than Cariloha by far, and less expensive too. The top sheet covers thick mattress so there is actually enough to tuck in sides. I highly recommend! "
PATRICIA,9 months ago,4,"I love these sheets, however a previous set of sheets had more elastic at the corners which is more preferable to me. these sheets are so smooth, that aspect makes if so easy to roll over with cotton jammies on. "
Get thin someday,4 months ago,5,"Best ever sheets that I have purchased!  Thick and soft quality with no tugging to put sheets on bed . Would expect to pay twice as much as competitors.  Love the set and with 4 pillow cases!  Thank you,Costco.. "
Monyie,9 months ago,5,I actually have not used these sheets yet. I bought them for my trailer but the quality is what I  come to expect for the price and from Costco. The sheets feel soft but thick. Will be great for my fall travels. 
Retired gal,7 months ago,5,These are great sheets. They are soft and wash up beautifully with no wrinkles.  I would recommend these to everyone.  Plus the price is right.  I was so happy to see that they made split California king sheets. 
BBMH,a year ago,4,The sheets have a nice feel and are comfortable to sleep on. The blue I ordered is really gray-blue. I would have preferred the light blue I thought was pictured. My only reservation is that they wrinkle a lot. 
golfan Di,4 months ago,5,I love the sturdiness of these sheets. Had bamboo before and they were just too clingy. Top sheet extra long. Fitted sheet has elastic all the way around for good fit. It’s marked for top and bottom. Buy these! 
Mike,5 months ago,5,Outstanding sheets. Feel clean and crisp. Thickness feels like they will last. Very comfortable on the skin. I liked the first set so much I bought another one. $20.00 off was a great bargain I couldn't resist. 
Kristi,3 months ago,5,"After years of paying too much for sheets, I found these and I love them. They are soft, wrinkle-free, and they do not pill. I finally replaced a set after 3 years for another color. They are just as beautiful! "
Kerry,a year ago,5,These sheets are worth every penny. A bit larger than most others is a plus. Pillow cases are large enough to envelope fold like a good  hotel would. They're generous weight makes them last and last for years. 
Elleysj,9 months ago,5,"These are the best sheets I have ever owned. They are soft, wash well and wear well. Like them so much I bought another set. No other sheets I have ever owned have ever lived up to the quality of these sheets. "
redhead,a year ago,5,"Was able to find split California king and these sheets are a real find.  Excellent quality cotton,  and If u remove from dryer immediately wrinkles not too bad. Ended up buying another set when back in stock. "
Grandma Jan,7 months ago,5,"Love these sheets.  They launder beautifully and are almost wrinkle free, unlike other 100% cotton sheets I have purchased.  I appreciate the top/bottom tab...takes the guesswork out of bottom sheet placement. "
Nora,4 months ago,5,Ordered these thinking I may not love them. But I DO love them. They feel lightly crispy and soft at the same time. They are very deep pocket so they will fit a bigger mattress than mine. I’d buy these again. 
Emlyn,4 months ago,5,These are everything I had hoped they would be! They are SO incredibly soft and luxurious. The weight of them is perfect and the deep pocket allows for precise fitting on our mattress. I will buy these again. 
GatorRay,a year ago,5,"The price is right and the product looks great. Time will tell about the durability. The sheets are soft and after the initial washing, they still look good. We are looking forward to some comfortable nights. "
Tooth Fairy,a year ago,5,A wonderful set of sheets! The bottom sheet fits well on our high profile mattress. The quality of the fabric is excellent. The top sheet and pillowcases needed a slight bit of ironing. No complaints from us! 
HDoyle,7 months ago,5,"I bought this sheet set even though I only need the fitted sheet, because the quality is great. It stays well around the mattress. I would love it to be even deeper, but it stays on well. Definitely recommend "
Fred,7 months ago,4,"It is slightly larger than I expected. It fits loosely. To make it a firm fitting, all edges require being tucked under mattress as snug as possible. The elastic goes all the way around the edge of the sheet "
jo ann,a year ago,5,"The color was as promised. The fabric is comfortably sturdy, and has a luxurious feel. They washed up beautifully. I would buy more if the color pallet was expanded. I am extremely pleased with these sheets. "
Kevin M,9 months ago,3,They are great sheets. But when I got them I immediately put them in the wash without examining them and there is an obvious manufacturers defect in the stitching toward one end. Didn't feel I should return 
Jharris,9 months ago,5,Received these sheets and took them out of the package and noticed that they smelled horrible but after washing them the smell went away.  Really good quality sheets and they are very deep.  Would recommend 
Jane,19 days ago,5,"These sheets are really soft. Synthetic sheets eventually get little balls of lint on them that end up making a sheet feel rough, but these all-cotton sheets have stayed soft. This is my 3rd set. Love them. "
Anonymous,9 months ago,5,Luxurious soft High thread count sheets that are very comfortable to sleep in 💜. The sets sell for a Very reasonable price for a hard to find size of Cal King sheets. Ordered 2 sets & will be ordering more 
Samantha,7 months ago,5,These sheets are good so far. I purchased the 650 thread count and had to return them bc the ripped very easily. Fingers crossed for these 800 thread count. They are soft and seem to be good quality so far. 
DrMonie,a year ago,5,"Such a great price and love the te tire, feel and weight of these sheets. First time buying this brand and type and am satisfied. One thing is it seems to be fraying a bit at the top on the decorative fold. "
Joan at the beach,3 months ago,5,"These sheets were a great purchase. They are so soft and wash so perfectly, very few wrinkles. I am one of those people that iron my sheets and with these I don’t have too. Would definitely purchase again. "
Denise25,9 months ago,5,If you like a thicker sheet then this is the set you’ll like. I bought these and the 680 sheets from Costco. These are thicker and not quite as satiny feeling which we liked better. Wash and dry well also. 
Nancy B,2 months ago,5,These sheets are excellent.  I have washed them several times and they are extremely soft and comfortable to sleep on.  I wish I would have bought an additional set when they were on sale.  Great Purchase. 
Yamma,a year ago,4,These are nice heavy sheets.  Just not as soft as I thought they would be.  I bought them online so didn’t feel them before purchase.  I’m sure they will last a long time but they won’t be a favorite set. 
c0stcor0cks,10 months ago,5,"Love these sheets.  They fit nicely with deep-pockets (king) and soft, comfortable feel. At 800 thread count they seem to be as good a quality or better than some higher thread count sheets that I've had. "
Racertay,2 months ago,5,These are my favorite sheets! Luxury at its finest. They are extremely soft and comfortable. I have both the Kirkland brand (680 count) and these. I like them both but prefer these as far as comfort goes. 
Gordo,6 months ago,5,Have been using them for over two years. Absolutely love them. Not flimsy like so many others. Hold up very well to years of washing. Feel cool. I’m convinced I get a better nights sleep when using them. 
JLO2,a month ago,4,Fabric washes well and feels good against the skin. We have adjustable split king TempurPedic mattress and fitted sheets need a little deeper corners to stay in place after movement. Overall a great buy. 
Jennifer Evans,9 months ago,5,"These are nice and big. I always have purchased the Kirkland 680 brand but they quit selling the split king. These are almost as good, but maybe a little warmer than the kirland. I am a very hot sleeper. "
Camos,a year ago,5,"Good night sleep every night! These are the best sheets ever. They wash up great & they are high quality. It’s great that they are tagged with, “side”, “top or bottom”,for ease for putting the sheets on. "
RVA Couple,a year ago,3,Still nice sheets but just not as good as they used to be. Have bought 2 sets of these previously but the quality and feel is just not quite as good. Especially since they are now so much more expensive. 
Oceanwatcher,7 months ago,4,These are incredible sheets. Great soft feel. There was a small raw edge not caught in sewing. I was able to repair it instead of sending them back as I needed the sheets immediately for a new mattress. 
mloft,a month ago,5,This is the second time we’ve purchased these sheets. We’re big fans due to their comfort and durability. A plus is that there are tags on all 4 sides of the fitted one that notes sides vs. top/bottom. 
Barb,8 months ago,5,"Loved them the moment I slipped into them.  They are so smooth and cool and just ""crisp"" enough.  Purchased the split California king.  Fitted sheets are a bit too wide (38 vs. our 36) but manageable. "
Phyllis S,a year ago,3,The sheets were too large for my Queen size bed tho it’s an expensive queen mattress with a padded mattress pad on top. They were also quite heavy and I like a thinner softer sheet. Had to return them. 
JohnC,9 months ago,5,"The fitted sheet actually fits a standard king 14"" mattress, whereas my previous Costco set, supposed to fit a 17"" mattress, required a full wrestling match to make the bed. Much happier with this set. "
Cindy,4 months ago,2,Fabric was excellent but the sewing stitches were too big with lots of loose threads.  Would not hold up under many washes. Would buy again if the stitching were tighter and no loose threads. Easy fix. 
Erin,9 months ago,5,"Nice quality comfortable sheet set. Deep pocket for thick mattress, sides/top/bottom indicated on fitted sheet, good length and width even after washing. Get softer with each washing. Highly recommend. "
John S,4 months ago,3,"They seem to be fraying alot at the seams.  I like the feel of them in bed but I wonder how long they will last.  Also, I did not recognize the shipper...they did not come from Costco.  Kinda strange. "
D Long,a year ago,5,We love these sheets. This set was for our sons bed. I tried the lower count (400) and there's no comparison. Plus the 4 pillowcases that are included make so much sense ! Great price for the quality. 
Christa,7 months ago,5,"We have 4 sets of these sheets in our guest house, and they are the most luxurious sheets we own. Easy to get on, they have a beautiful luster to them, and clearly very high quality.  We love them. "
Overboard,4 months ago,4,"These sheets are very nice, comfortable and heavier than most. Definitely hotel quality sheets purchase the split king and I find it very nice that the fitted sheets stay on the beds. Very well done. "
Rhoda,7 months ago,5,"I was looking for high quality, crisp sheets. These are high quality but a bit softer than I wanted. I decided to keep them and am happy with my purchase. I really like that there are 4 pillow cases. "
CassieLee,9 months ago,5,"Finding good split kings is not easy. This set comes with FOUR king size pillow cases, most come with 2 standard size cases. Very soft, wash nice and fit perfectly. This is the 2nd set I have bought. "
Taryn B,9 months ago,4,"The material is nice but they fit big on the mattress.  I guess if you have a super high pillow top mattress it would be ok, but for our 13"" mattress, there's a lot of extra fabric and it bunches up. "
Andrew N,3 months ago,5,"Excellent value for the price. The sheets launder and dry well, and the fabric is smooth and thick. The best feature is that the long and short sides of the fitted bottom sheet are labeled! At last!! "
Allison,a year ago,5,They are silky smooth and very comfortable.  They fit my thick mattress beautifully and have plenty of length for the tuck in at the foot of the bed.  I think they’re the nicest sheets I’ve ever had. 
Anonymous,23 days ago,5,We’ve used Kirkland top tier sheets for 20 Years and recently had to switch to this brand because Kirkland cal king wasn’t available. This brand is much softer and feels significantly higher quality. 
rcragun,5 months ago,5,I like high quality sheets. These have the perfect combination of thickness and softness to convince me that they ave really good quality. I've thoroughly enjoyed sleeping in them for the last week. 
Mightymoose,2 months ago,5,"Excellent sheets, almost satin like texture, with the high thread count they feel like they can keep you warm even without a blanket (when it warms up).  I anticipate that they will last many years. "
CostcoShopper,25 days ago,4,"Very sturdy sheets but a little warm. They are finally starting to soften after @5 washes but still 'not soft'. They are very well made and comfortable, but if you sleep hot they may not be for you. "
3dayeventer,a year ago,5,Bought these and an expensive set ($400). Compared them. Liked these better although they do take a few washes to soften up. Fit the split king adjustable base when others would not. Will buy again. 
Wallace,14 days ago,5,"These sheets are terrific.  800 thread count at an amazing price.  These are not thin and cheap feeling.  They have a good quality weight and really last.  Loved them so much, purchased 2 more sets. "
Anne,a year ago,5,"After trying all the new fangled materials for sheets, I've come full circle back to this wonderful set of cotton sheets. Sleep is so much better... My body can breathe instead of being suffocated. "
Kathy,a year ago,4,"Good quality sheet set, fits my 12 in. mattress with a 3 in. foam topper and stays in place. My only negative is for a set said to be cotton sateen it does not have the silky feel I was hoping for. "
Mamalahmma,9 months ago,5,"Sheets are crisp and feel substantial. Very comfortable. Added bonus, the fitted sheet has tags that say side and end so that you know exactly how to put it on the mattress without trial and error. "
Big Wave Dave,8 months ago,5,"I was skeptical after trying so many sheets, especially for C King size. These are very luxurious, soft and fit the bed perfectly. My only upgrade would be to make them a bit wider and not as long. "
Tuxedo,a year ago,5,These sheets are very nice and a great value. The fitted sheet fits nicely on our thick mattress. The flat sheet is long enough to reach the top of the bed and still tuck under the foot of the bed. 
N Guenther,7 months ago,5,"These are the best sheets ever!  They are soft and have some thickness, but they feel cool, but keep you warm at the same time.  They wash well and maintain their greatness even after many washes. "
Kris,9 months ago,5,These sheets are soft and smooth and they don’t wrinkle badly when washed. I love the labels that say  top/bottom or side on the fitted sheet. They’re a great value and they include 4 pillowcases! 
Chuck Vold,15 days ago,4,The sheets do not wrinkle. the color is nice.  I ordered a King size and  they are really large.  I have to tuck them in on the side because they there is so much fabric.  They are a nice quality. 
stlricky,a year ago,3,"Some of the previous reviews were right about one thing-these sheets really stink when first opened. Fortunately, the smell dissipates with the first wash. Overall, I can find nothing special about these sheets versus their 600 thread count, everyday sheets. As a matter of fact, I'm a little ticked by the fact the bottom sheet does not fit snugly on my mattress. Given the fact that it is nearly 16"" tall, I thought just about any sheet would fit snugly however, each time I wake up and make the bed it is necessary to dig under the comforter/blankets and top sheet to pull it taut from the bottom. That wouldn't be an issue if everything else didn't want to pull down with it.Everything else is about average-really no discernable difference between 600 and 800 thread count (I own both). The pillowcases do not have what I refer to as holding pockets. They do launder a bit more nicely than the 600 count, showing fewer wrinkles. Overall, a good buy but I do not plan on purchasing any more. Just not worth the price difference and besides, the lower priced sheets fit my mattress much more tightly. "
Computer Nut,a month ago,5,These sheets are much thicker than the ones we purchased in the Costco warehouse and feel like they will last a lot longer. They are comfortable and fit our California King Sleep Number mattress. 
KADS,10 months ago,3,Sheets feel nice. I bought the queen size for my queen size mattress which has an average plus height and the sheets are baggy. I want tight fitting sheets and these did not meet my expectations. 
coffee hound,7 months ago,5,"Very happy with these sheets we have bought 2 sets, deep pockets fit nicely on two different mattresses.. Compare to Ralph Laurens we have bought in the last ten years won't even consider again. "
Jdolet,a month ago,5,I bought these sheets along with the kirkland brand sheets from Coatco. These are much better and way more comfortable. If your looking at sheets from Costco these would be the ones I recommend. 
FanciNan,4 months ago,5,I purchased these sheet as a gift and the main reason I did was because they are 800 thread count which make for high quality sheets.  They should also be very soft to your skin while you sleep. 
Lolo,3 months ago,5,We’re hot sleepers and will only use this brand AND thread count! We only buy when on sale but it’s so comfortable and the fitted sheets are easy to get on but don’t slip off! Really love these! 
Arleenie,6 months ago,5,These sheets are expensive but well worth it. My daughter and I have been buying these sheets for over 4 years. they are thick quality and With wrinkle release.Can be folded almost like ironing 
fitid2userules,8 months ago,4,I like them better than the ones from sleep number.  Only wish we could buy separates.  I don't use the whole set (top sheet) but haven't found a source for split california king bottom sheets. 
PattiC,9 months ago,5,"I love these sheets and I'm so glad that Costco has carried them for a few years. They're soft, comfortable and fit my thick mattress. No other sheets feel the same last these. Love, love them. "
MissMyrn,9 months ago,3,Sheets are silky but not thick or soft like Egyptian cotton sheets.  I would have kept them anyway but the split king fitted sheets where not tight enough which made them wrinkle underneath me. 
Who cares what my nicknam,a year ago,4,The 800 thread count cotton sheets are great! I’ve been waiting for Costco to get them in again. Not as firm and smooth as the original ones but a lot better than anything they have right now. 
Sandy E,8 months ago,5,"These are the best cotton sheets I’ve ever slept on. So happy with them.  They wash nicely with minimal wrinkles.  Great price at Costco, way cheaper than any other sheets I’d been looking at. "
Mush,3 months ago,3,"These are nice sheets, but they are too big for a queen bed. There is no way to tuck in the top sheet, and the fitted sheet isn’t much better.  For the price, I expected them to fit perfectly. "
Bzeh42,5 months ago,5,"Really enjoy these sheets.  Very comfortable, washes nicely and the tags that show which side is top/bottom or side helps making the bed easier to make.  This was the third set I have ordered. "
beachdude_805,a year ago,5,These are the best sheets we have ever purchased.  We've been waiting for Costco to bring them back.  They stay warm in the winter and cool in the summer.  The weight and feel are outstanding. 
Anonymous,9 months ago,5,"An extra star for the ""Side"" and""Top/Bottom"" labels sewn into the fitted sheet for the easiest bed making! After their first wash out of the pack, they feel very luxurious and cool on our bed! "
martinandcat,a year ago,5,"I bought this set of sheets in white, and may I just say they are so beautiful and so nice to sleep on.  They do have some stray strings but nothing like a pair of scissor to make them perfect "
Buyer,9 months ago,5,"Very good quality.  Love these, but they are really large.  We have the King split set and the twin fitted sheets are large and would definitely work on very deep mattresses. Would order more. "
PHattexas,8 months ago,5,I love these sheets. This is the second pair I hav bought. My first pair lasted six years. They are so soft and keeps me cool throughout the terrible Texas summer heat. I couldn't be happier. 
Great Lakes,7 months ago,3,So far 3 sets have stains on the flat sheet other than that they have that crisp sateen feeling.  They don't wrinkle too badly.  Love the elastic on the entire perimeter of the fitted sheet. 
Efur,9 months ago,5,Super nice - step up from the Costco brand cotton sheets (which we love!)- these have even more thickness and ‘luxury’ feel to them. Would get another if I could afford it at this juncture :) 
Melinda C250,9 months ago,5,"Sheets are our favorites. They wear very well. We love the soft luxurious feel and if we get them right out of the dryer, they don’t wrinkle. We’ve got several sets of these excellent sheets. "
JL Arena,a year ago,5,We bought these sheets a few years ago from our local warehouse. We love them so much we bought our second set from the Costco website. They are so soft and luxurious! Highly recommend these. 
Salin TX,5 months ago,2,"I just received it today, and I was ready to use it after washing it. After the first time, the pillowcase began to puff, and the quality was not as good as expected. I was very disappointed. "
J H W,9 months ago,4,I love the sheets but the pillow cases are for king size pillows and I don’t know a would who needs 4 king size pillowcases and having them altered is an added expense.  But love the sheets. 
mitp,a year ago,5,very thick high quality fabric.  A nice sateen finish that sheds wrinkles. Convenient labels for sides vs. top edges and extra elastic in fitted sheet corners make it easier to make the bed. 
Ms Westie,7 months ago,5,"Absolutely the most comfortable sheets I’ve ever slept In. They stay cool and comfortable, and the thread count makes them smooth and crisp. It’s like sleeping in a luxury hotel every night. "
Deb92040,a year ago,5,I love these sheets and as soon as they go on promo again I’ll be ordery3 more sets for my beds. They are really nice. I also told a friend about them and she’s getting them also!  Thank you 
Marie,10 months ago,5,"These sheets were on a king bed at a VRBO where we stayed.  We really liked them, and ordered them for our home.  Very comfortable and soft and not a thin material. Washes well, nice weight. "
Lisa P,a year ago,5,"Great quality! I am very picky with my sheets, I love these!  Came out of the dryer great and I love that they have elastic all the way around, and labels to tell you how to put on the bed! "
Anonymous,9 months ago,4,"The cal-king fitted sheet doesn't seem to fit nicely. It's pretty loose fitting. I prefer a more form fitting sheet so it's not so wrinkly when laying on it. Nice quality of the fabric, tho "
Airborne Grandma,a year ago,5,"We love these sheets! This is like our 6th set we have purchased. They are thicker than other sheets, so they are substantial feeling, and very soft. They wash up well and last a long time. "
Kath,7 months ago,3,"Not what I expected- washed and I feel like they are rough - not soft and smooth.  Color was off - but, not a problem.  Will probably return.   For such a high thread count I expected more. "
Mitch,a year ago,5,"Fitted sheet has deep pockets that stay on the mattress, and flat sheet is generous in size. The quality and softness of the sheets exceeds that of much more expensive sheets for the price. "
Steve,a year ago,5,"Super soft, excellent price. It should be 4.5 as our last set started pilling (despite always washing in delicate cycle alone). But we immediately replaced them, so that says we loved them! "
Regina,8 months ago,5,"These are the best sheets for the price, very soft and size is perfect.  Only downside for us is included with the king set are 4 very large pillowcases, we needed to alter to normal sizes. "
MollyM,a year ago,3,"I am sure that these are the same wonderful quality as my beige sheets.  However, tbey are NOT  blue.  They are more of a seafoam green and will be returned on my next visit to Costco.  🙁 "
SAYTravel,a year ago,4,"I love the Kirkland 680 sheets but wanted to try these higher-count sheets. They are very nice but a little bit thicker than I’m used to.  Not bad, just different. Very nice sheets though. "
Linda W,7 months ago,5,Wow. These are wonderful sheets. They are very soft. They are large enough to fit the California king bed. Some sheets are tight and you have to struggle to get them on the bed. Not these. 
Hmoore364,a year ago,5,"I love these sheets! This is my second time buying them because my dog tore the first set. They are just as nice as the first time. They are thick and smooth, and they just feel luxurious. "
Jan K,9 months ago,3,The fabric is wonderful but the workmanship is shoddy. Lots of loose threads and a hole in the seam of a pillowcase. I will keep and stitch up the pillowcase but I find that disappointing. 
Transistor747,a year ago,5,"I waited for these sheets to become available vs the 400 count sheets. They are wonderful!!!  We had these sheets in the past, and they wore out. We bought 2 pairs this time. Thanks Costco "
Costco Kat,10 months ago,5,"800 thread count cotton sheets are very nice, sturdy, heavy and thick. Fitted sheets have great deep pockets. You may not like these sheets if you’re interested in sheets that feel softer. "
JMoon,a year ago,5,"These sheets are beautiful! After washing, the look of these sheets are elegant and the feel is luxurious. I've never bought an 800-hundred count set of sheets. There is no going back now. "
Anonymous,a year ago,5,"I absolutely love my new sheets that I purchased from Costco warehouse, on sale last month. They arrived on time and I didn’t have to leave my home! Thank you!! I love shopping at Costco! "
Anonymous,20 days ago,5,"Heavier than other sheets which feels great, very deep pockets that work with adjustable bed, large king flat sheet that allows both sides to have enough extra sheet cover when sleeping. "
E Fielder,a year ago,5,"My favorite feature...the tags on the hem of the king size fitted sheet stating top/bottom or side. So simple, yet so brilliant. Very nice quality. Comes with four king size pillowcases. "
dkssn,9 months ago,5,"Sheets are lovely and soft.   The fitted sheet is a bit tight for our very thick mattress; another inch would have been helpful.   But the fabric is good, and the price quite reasonable. "
Leslie,5 months ago,5,These are the most awesome sheets ever. Like sleeping on a soft cloud. They are beautiful and the quality is outstanding. Won’t ever buy any other kinds of sheets again. Thank you Costco 
Lisa K,3 months ago,5,Theses are the finest wellMade sheets I have ever bought. They even have a label for top and side so you can figure out how to put the fitted sheet on. This is my 2nd set … I am in love 
Ellen,5 days ago,1,Had the sheets for less than a year and they are shredding 
MilitarySpouse,4 months ago,5,"The fabric of these sheets is soft, yet a good fabric weight and sturdy.  Definitely not flimsy!  Excellent quality!  Bought the split king size which includes 4 king size pillow cases. "
Quina,2 months ago,5,The Hotel Signature 800 thread count sheet set is the most comfortable set I have ever used. It washes really well and fits the bed nicely.it is extremely soft. I highly recommend it.!! 
A T W,11 months ago,5,The thing I like best beside the quality and 4 pillowcases. and deep mattress pocket ..someone finally had the smarts to put a tag one the side of the bottom sheet saying SIDE  BRILLANT 
MGBG,a year ago,5,I was intially concerned when ordering these sheets no knowing what I was going to get.  I am very pleased with the grey set I ordered.  They are comfortable and the material is strong. 
TheCush,a year ago,5,These sheets are super soft and luxurious.  They are so much nicer and more comfortable than ordinary percale sheets.  They are also a great value at less than $100 for a six-piece set. 
char,9 months ago,5,"We have purchased this brand a number of times. I wish they had the striped sheets again but alas these are the same just without the stripes. We love them, high quality, keep you cool. "
S Reed,4 months ago,5,"IMO, these are the BEST sheets for the money. I am some what of a sheet snob and these are better than the sheets costing triple the price! Soft, luxurious, quality galore! I love them! "
Nalini,a year ago,3,"Not a good quality for the price and 800 count sheets.  Stitches were not done properly, some places they were loose and coming off.  Some edges were showing some fuzz type material!!!! "
macbry,a year ago,5,"We have enjoyed the comfort of these new sheets as well as the high quality. They are not cheap, especially for Costco. But the old adage, you get what you pay for is true in this case. "
Amber,a year ago,2,"These sheets smelled even after washing, and felt like cardboard to lay on. SO scratchy and rough. I was so disappointed. Purchased Kirkland 680 sheets and  much happier with the feel! "
Mary,5 months ago,5,"Super quality heavy duty sheet set with silky feel and easy maintenance. Remove immediately from the dryer and few wrinkles. A great price for a great set of sheets. Thank you, Costco. "
Costco Mom,a year ago,5,We absolutely love these sheets. They are very high quality.  They even have tags sewn in that indicate which side you are at making it a snap to make the bed. They are thick and soft. 
Gretchen,a month ago,3,"The quality of the material is very good.  However, the sheets stretch out during use and become a mass of wrinkled fabric.  I prefer the Kirkland brand sheets because they fit better. "
Marty,a year ago,5,"Purchased Cal King - fit bed well, top sheet large enough to tuck in easily bottom and sides.  Love that they identify top/bottom and sides.  The sheets are soft and very comfortable . "
R S G,a year ago,5,"Best sheets. Thick, luxurious, unlike any other sheet set. Worth the cost and beyond. Don’t waste your time and money with anything else. The white has less sheen than the color sets. "
Judy CRNA,8 months ago,5,"These sheets are smooth, wash well, sewn well, lovely color.  They fit my 18 inch mattress without a problem.  I am so glad I was able to purchase the dark blue ones(not shown above). "
Patty,11 months ago,5,"I was looking for a new set of sheets for awhile and theses are the bomb!  Great thread count that is soft to the touch and they don’t wrinkle much. Also, very generous in the sizing. "
Suzanne,5 months ago,5,"This is the best sheet set I have ever purchased. I love the texture, the weight and the feel of these sheets. The pieces are generously sized for our split king bed. Worth the price. "
Anonymous,8 months ago,5,"These are excellent for the price. I prefer wrinkle free bed sheets and these are pretty good. Easy to make the bed. I think 800 count is over kill but again, for the price who cares. "
fmorelli,8 months ago,5,"Excellent. Not cheap and worth every penny. Very well made, very nice weight. A first rate hotel sheet set. We came from using Biltmore sheets which used to be good but went downhill. "
Susan,11 months ago,5,"Couldn't ask for nicer sheets.  They do better with deep mattresses.  Our mattress isn't especially deep so a little extra tucking is needed.  Other than that, these sheets are great. "
Wayne,a year ago,3,Went on sale before I receive sheets 
laree,7 months ago,5,"Wonderful soft sheets.I stayed in a b& b, I asked where they bought their sheets, COSCO! i had to buy my own. 4 pillow cases are great. Im going to buy them for Christmas presents!!! "
Rita W,a year ago,2,"It took 12 days to receive the sheets. I ordered ""blue"" and received ""olive"" sheets. I did not return them, as how long might that have taken? Not real happy with costco.com service. "
Joe P,10 months ago,5,"Excellent sheets, tremendous value!  Soft, silky and high quality at a fraction of the cost of equivalent sheets that you’ll find at high-end departments stores.  Highly recommended! "
Rocketdog13,a year ago,5,"Pretty happy with these sheets so far. They fit the mattress and pillows well, washed/dried nicely without noticeable shrinking. Comfortable and don't make you overheat. Queen/white. "
Joji,9 months ago,4,"I washed it first  before using it, but was very surprised that it came out of the drier wrinkled.  I thought 800-thread cotton will be wrinkle free.  Overall, the fitting is good . "
David,4 months ago,5,"If you are like me, you are looking for a crisp set of comfortable sheets that will remind of awesome hotel bedding. These are the ones. Look no further or you will waste your time. "
Susan,7 months ago,5,"High quality sheets! Love the directional guides for top/bottom and sides. Only downside is that the top sheet seems short on the  side to side distance, not much length to tuck in. "
House,5 months ago,5,These are very comfortable sheets. Have been buying them for several years. The price is great for this quality. I have purchased 6 sets in the past six years. They don't wear out. 
FL Lolly,4 months ago,4,The elastic band on the fitted sheet is nice and wide and easy to put in place. The flat and fitted sheets are very accommodating for deep mattresses. I just wish they were softer. 
Ameet M,3 months ago,4,I prefer the Kirkland 600 count sheets (they are softer). It's possible these may be more durable though. I had an issue with the 600 count sheets ripping after a few years of use. 
Andrealize,a year ago,5,These are amazing. My husband and I are hot sleepers and these keep us cool. I have washed them about 4 times now and they still look new. I will get more pairs as they go on sale! 
SSF23,a year ago,5,"I would buy these again in a heartbeat. Super soft, they stay pretty wrinkle free, the colors looked good in person, and the fitted sheet is a breeze to put on. Thank you Costco ;) "
ghattaway,a year ago,5,"These are just the best sheets! Weight, fit, features - all stellar for this price point! I especially love the sewn in labels on the fitted sheet that identify top/bottom or side. "
Denise,a year ago,3,These are definitely sized right for our extra deep mattress. They are rather thin and don't feel as cotton-y as I expected. Time will tell but I will probably not buy another set. 
willow61,6 months ago,5,"After washing them, they are very soft. Plenty of room for fitted bottom sheets on the Cal King split. The top sheet I need to reduce the with so it will fit on one split mattress. "
Tom H,a year ago,5,We have only had these sheets for about 2 weeks but I can attest that they are the best feeling sheets we have had in recent memory (if not ever). We can't wait to buy another set. 
Karen,a year ago,4,These are great the only thing is they tend to have loose threads around the top where seem is .  I like they wash great dry aren’t too heavy last longer than the 680 thread count. 
CCNC,a year ago,5,"These sheets are amazingly nice to the touch and, of course, they sleep well. I have sets for all my beds and give them as gifts to family (so I can sleep on them during visits!). "
Gardengal,a year ago,4,Nice Queen sheet set.  They are soft with a high thread count.  I like that there are four pillow cases.  The only downside is that the elastic on the fitted sheet is a bit loose. 
atlcommuter,7 months ago,5,Great sheets. Comfort at a great price. Extra pillow cases are a welcome addition. I was wanting more of a sea glass blue like the images but the actual fabric leans towards blue. 
Jase,4 months ago,3,"These sheets look nice, but the fitted sheet does run a little large (I'm assuming for really thick mattresses) so it doesn't fit as taut as I'd like.  But the quality seems good. "
rama,9 months ago,4,"Love the product, great quality. Pricy (main reason for 4 stars ) but you get what you pay for. Hoping this investment will last for YEARS though, or else the price isnt worth it "
Roslyn,10 months ago,5,"These sheets are worth every penny!   I have not had more comfortable sheets.  The quality, workmanship, fit and comfort are all 5 stars in my opinion!  I would highly recommend. "
SKD2019,a year ago,5,I have purchased numerous expensive sheets elsewhere but this set absolutely tops every other brand. Luxuriously soft no matter how many times they have been washed. Great value. 
Greg,a year ago,5,"Nice weight, stays in place.  Gives your body something to snuggle into. Compared to 600 count this is much more dense but not heavy or bulky. Good value compared to dept stores. "
Andrea,4 months ago,3,"Love the feel and texture, but the fitted sheet is about 1 inch too small. I had to really fight to get the last corner secured and even so was unable to pull it down completely. "
Digit,a year ago,5,This sheet set washed up well. The fabric is very smooth to the touch and is relatively heavy compared to all other sheets I’ve had over the years. Very happy with this purchase. 
Margie K,10 months ago,5,The sheets are perfect -- from the thread count to the sateen finish to their weight and to their washability. I ordered one pair and was so thrilled that I ordered a second set. 
RKirkley,a month ago,4,These sheets are a great for fit for our cal king bed. It’s our second set as the first one finally wore thin after 5 years of daily use. The fabric is cool and soft to the touch 
Colton,a year ago,5,Amazing quality and on the King set there are tags to call out top/sides. Purchased a king and a queen set.  Very smooth and crisp.  Deep pockets and would highly purchase again. 
Jersey Joyce,6 days ago,5,Excellent product. Superior quality. I was so impressed/pleaded that I purchased it again as a gift for my son in his new home. 
L Rohrer,4 months ago,1,These sheets were beautifully packaged but that was all that was great about them. They were stiff and heavy. Most uncomfortable sheets I have ever encountered. I returned them. 
MJinCA,a year ago,5,"Our last sheets were the Kirkland Signature set from the warehouse. (less than $100). After a few years they ripped, so we got these and LOVE them! Definitely worth the splurge. "
Cornhusker Lady,4 months ago,5,These sheets are exactly what I’ve been looking for. The corners have vertical elastic that improves their fit. The only way you might improve them would be using wider elastic 
Benny C,3 months ago,5,I found a set at our local store and I liked them so much I went online and bought 2 more sets. Very soft yet crisp and cool at the same time. The best sheets I’ve ever bought. 
DAN PSP,a year ago,5,"Another excellent value & quality product from Costco. Bottom sheets fit thick mattress with room to spare. Beautiful texture, details. tho' beige color is more grey to my eye. "
EventGuy,7 months ago,5,Love these sheets & cases! The fitted sheet has elastic gathered corners making it super easy to apply. Offer a no iron effect and are silky and comfy. They wash & dry quickly. 
Muss,a year ago,5,"Exceptional,  reccomended. The last King set I purchased from Costco, the bottom fitted sheet was not correct and pulled free from time to time. I seems they fixed this issue. "
B Bell,a year ago,3,These sheets have much more sheen to them than the original 800 count I bought from you several years ago.  I would prefer that they have much less sheen and more cotton feel. 
Gigi,a year ago,5,"Very high quality sheets.  Still on our 1st week of sleeping on them so I don’t know how they’ll hold up long term, but I expect they’ll do well.   Would definitely recommend. "
Debbie,3 months ago,5,"I have been looking for this type of sheet for a long time. They’re perfect, they’re crisp they’re thick they’re so comfortable and they fit my mattress and wash up very well. "
Donna49,9 months ago,5,"These sheets are outstanding!  They maintain their smooth sheen, seam edges stay flat and, on the fitted bottom sheet, even the corners have stretch in them for a tighter fit. "
J Underwood,9 months ago,3,"Sheets are fine. However, the pillowcases do not have a European envelope closure to trap the pillow inside the case. There are better sheet sets out there for the same price. "
Trevor,4 months ago,5,"I think this is the perfect thread count for us. The sheets are soft yet sturdy, and fit the bed with a little extra material. Should feel comfortable in warm or cool seasons. "
Gail,a year ago,4,"These sheets are durable and heavy cotton. They are made ample enough to easily fit over mattresses that may have toppers without having to ""fight"" to stretch them to fit on. "
chilihead711,9 months ago,5,"We're very happy with these sheets, they have a nice feel and look great. No complaints at all, in fact we went ahead and ordered another set while they're still marked down. "
SheetMaster,10 months ago,4,"Excellent quality. A bit too roomy, there’s a lot of extra material making the sheets loose.  A bit more form is better. I do like the elastic around the bottom fitted sheet. "
Danielle,a year ago,5,I’m very happy with these sheets. It is a good combination of soft and comfortable. They feel thick and like they will last a long time. Glad I got them. Will by another set. 
RobinF,a year ago,5,These are high quality sheets that last a long time.  The extra touch of having labels indicating side or bottom placement are extremely helpful.  You won't be disappointed! 
Tim w,a year ago,4,I’ve only had them a week but they seem to be really nice sheets.  Plenty big enough for my new Casper mattress.  They don’t sleep hot and are soft enough to be comfortable. 
JudyCRNA,a year ago,5,"Should have purchased more in the King size.  Beautifully smooth, 100% cotton, rich color in gray, wash easily, extra long pillow cases.  I will be watching for these again! "
Xman,9 months ago,5,Very luxurious feel love the little tags stating top bottom or side of fitted sheet makes bed much easier to make nice fit best deal and quality for the price will buy again 
Don M,4 months ago,5,Deep pocket fitted sheet along with a top sheet and 4 pillowcases. Bought the Cal King size and was not disappointed. They feel really nice. You can go wrong in buying them. 
Pleased as punch,3 months ago,4,"Absolutely love the feel and texture of these sheets. Very crisp, yet soft. Love that there are indicators on the side of the fitted sheet that ensures you have it on right. "
Greg,a year ago,4,"Very good sheets. The sheets were excellent quality, durable, and felt nice to my skin, but, to keep them from wrinkling i took them out of dryer and folded them right away. "
MartinaV,a year ago,5,"Not only feels great, the fit is GREAT!  The deep stretch corner pockets are the best I've had to date!  Love the sets I ordered, I will be purchasing for all beds in house! "
Intutti8,4 months ago,5,"These sheets are of great quality. They do not wrinkle after washing and drying. The pillowcases are very long, but the sheets fit our California king perfectly. A good buy. "
Jenne Duerler,11 months ago,5,Love these sheets! I bought them a few years ago and I've been looking for them ever since. I need to buy another set. Nice heavy material and I love the feel. Very durable 
Dad1,a year ago,4,Well made and comfortable.  Hopefully they will wear well but only time will tell.  Looking forward to see how they hold up.  Seem very durable yet feel great at same time. 
BBLover,a year ago,3,"Not sure these 800 thread count feel any better than my 500.  Also, opening the plastic package had a horrible, strong organic chemical smell.  Had to wash them right away. "
Jo C,4 months ago,5,"Love, love, love these sheets. The set comes with 4 pillowcases which is unusual and outstanding! The fitted sheet has elastic all the way around it! The price was amazing! "
Love my bed,9 months ago,5,"Best sheets ever,  have tried so many and so many high thread counts.  They fit well on DEEP mattresses, and are so soft and great quality.  I bought in 2 different colors. "
Midwest Mom,4 months ago,5,"You spend a third of your life in bed and I believe you should invest in the BEST. With these sheets, it feels like I'm sleeping on a luxurious cloud.  I'm buying more now! "
Sunshine,5 months ago,4,"Excellent quality.  I like the feel and detect no odor.  My only complaint would be the sheets are too big for my mattress, but should be perfect for an oversized mattress. "
AliM,8 months ago,5,"These sheet sets are especially nice!  Perhaps a bit roomy, but easier to make up bed.  I have them for our queen bed and Split Cal King bed.  Love the feel and appearance. "
DeeLou,a year ago,5,These are the best sheets I have ever slept on. The price is so reasonable compared to other high quality sheets! I love them. It feels like I’m staying at a premium hotel!

Kitchen Diva,3 months ago,5,"I love the feel of these sheets.  They are very very soft.  They are 100% cotton, and yet they came out of the dryer wrinkle free.  I liked these so much I bought 3 sets. "
Pat b,a year ago,3,"I have not used them yet, but they smell awful in the box.  I have been putting the box outside on my porch in nice weather to see if the smell goes away before unfolding "
Sue328,3 months ago,2,"I wanted to love the sheets. The fabric and thread count were very high quality but unfortunately,  the stitching on the top sheet hems were flawed. I had to return them. "
Lucy,a year ago,3,Sheets feel really nice. Been using for 3 plus years. Look nice for 25 washes; using Kirkland detergent and delicate cycles. Tons of small holes and replace by 40 washes. 
Dolores,5 months ago,5,Love these sheets.  So soft and comfortable .  Bought one set to try and then bought more for myself as well as my two daughters.  I  now say they are my favorite sheets. 
Barbara Burton,4 months ago,1,I love these sheets.  The other sheets at Costco are terrible as so wrinkled.  I was talking with someone in the bedding aisle in Costco and she recommended these sheets. 
Judy,a year ago,4,Nice and soft sheets.  The stitching inside pillowcases is not good.  Looks like they could come apart.  But I love the feel of the sheets and the pocket depth is great. 
Diane,9 months ago,5,Only sheets I will buy.  Love the fitted corners for a Temprapedic  mattress since it is thick and STAY!  Soft 100% cotton soft and cool at the same time.  I love them😍 
Anonymous,21 days ago,4,These sheets are nice but they are very long and not wide enough for my tastes. We put them on sideways so the longer part of the sheet is on the side. (California King) 
Lori,4 months ago,4,"Sheets are really nice with a smooth finish and I like the color. They are heavier and a little rougher after the first wash, but will most likely soften more with use. "

Aaron,10 months ago,5,"A very good, cost-effective set of sheets.  While not the softest set of sheets at 800 thread count, these are perfect for a backup set of sheets for when guests come. "
Mare mare,9 months ago,5,"I am very pleased with the quality of these sheets! Super soft, and the tags on the fitted sheets that show top or bottom vs sides are very helpful.  Highly recommend! "
Vince,2 months ago,5,Very comfortable sheets and pillow cases to sleep on. Quality construction and the side and end labels make it easy to choose the correct position of the sheet to use. 
Nita,3 months ago,5,The bottom sheet fit perfectly on all sides. The flat sheet is extra long so the foot e d stays tucked in. They launder beautifully on low temp water and low heat dry. 
R Triplett,11 months ago,5,These heavy duty cotton sheets are super soft and comfortable and they stay drier and cooler than non-cotton alternatives. These should last years even with daily use. 
wxg1,4 months ago,5,"These sheets scream quality.  They are soft to the touch, comfortable, and come out of the dryer nearly wrinkle free.  Perfect sheets in every way.   Highly recommend. "
RcWi,5 months ago,4,love these sheets- only wish they still had the extra elastic on the sides of the fitted sheet- that was such a great feature.  otherwise it would have been a 5 star. 
HappyInOregon,4 months ago,5,"These sheets are wonderful, easily the best we have ever owned. We have both split king and queen sets. Both the bottom fitted and the top sheet are generously sized. "
Teri,4 months ago,5,These sheets are wonderful. They come out of the drier only minimally wrinkled. The finish is smooth but the sheets have weight to them. I just ordered my second set! 
Costco Shopper,9 months ago,5,Love the quality of the sheets and the size is great (king).  The price is great also but I wish they had a sea spray blue/green color choice.  Only 4 color choices.

Panne628,9 months ago,4,"Great value. Nice weight and I didn't find that I had to iron them like I usually do with my sheets, although I likely will. Love that they come with 4 pillow cases. "
Anonymous,a year ago,5,Follow the fabric care instructions and resist the urge to dry this at maximum heat. Very soft and comfy. Will go great on that spare bedroom when the in-laws visit. 
LMMa,a year ago,5,Enjoyed these sheets at a VRBO in October but they were out of stock in the color and size I wanted. Checked daily and was excited to get these sheets for both beds.

stevenlars,a year ago,5,Excellent quality sheets - you will not regret spending a little extra money for the luxurious feeling when you crawl into bed (where we spend +\- 1/3 of our lives! 
Panda_Lover,4 months ago,3,"sewn poorly, several threads loose.  I'm not sure if 800 count is supposed to feel hard and crunchy as I never had this count thread before.  Deep pockets are good. "
Carrie,11 months ago,5,"I love these sheets. They fit well, top sheet is very large, they are very soft as well. They had a bad oder when I opened them but after washing the odor was gone. "
Judy,a year ago,4,We'd give it five stars if it didn't wrinkle so much. Sheet are very comfortable; we like the elastic on the corners and the orientation labels on the fitted sheet.

Babs,10 months ago,5,"Awesome sheets! This is my second set. My husband and I like these sheets better than any others we’ve tried. They are soft, have few wrinkles and are comfortable. "
catwalk70,a year ago,4,Good quality comfortable fabric. But why are hems sewn before side seams? This leaves the sheets and pillowcases short of excellence. Still the best for the price. 
DC44,a year ago,5,These are much heavier than most sheets and will last a long time.   They washed nicely and are soft and comfy.   Love how they fit my super thick bottom mattress.

Charles,4 months ago,5,"Although we just recently received this handsomely crafted set, thus far it is the best fitting, most comfortable, and easy to manage sheet set we have ever owned. "
P Austin,9 months ago,3,Washed immediately after taking the sheets out of the packaging. Threads/strings hanging on top sheet at the cuff. Shouldn’t be on a new pair of 800 thread count! 
deerchaser,3 months ago,3,Not the same.  These new sheets are stiff and when removed from packaging have a strange and unpleasant odor.  Hopefully they will soften up after several washes. 
Warren,10 months ago,3,"Very nice feel, heavy weight due to the thread count. I wish the pockets were deeper/longer. With a thick mattress and protection cover, we needed longer pockets. "
MANG,9 months ago,4,They feel thick and were stiff after the first wash but got softer after the second wash. I'm expecting that they will most likely get softer after continued use. 
Vibs,a year ago,5,"These sheets are ,by far, the best I’ve ever owned! In the past I’ve bought much more expensive sheets,but they were never as comfortable as the ones from Costco. "
sandmor,8 months ago,5,These sheets are superb. They are heavier than most and sublimely soft and smooth. They are luxury sheets you would see at hundreds of dollars. A steal at Costco.

Warmair,a year ago,5,Great sheets at a great price.  The bottom fitted sheet is very deep for thicker mattresses.  The pillow cases are very large and generous size for King pillows. 
Perfect for our needs,a year ago,5,Great improvement over old sheets. Deep pockets for our very think mattress are perfect and really appreciate the side and bottom/top labels on the fitted sheet. 
Mrs Tim,5 months ago,5,"I love these sheets. They hold up well, are well constructed and are soft, almost satiny. For the price you pay, you get a wonderful sheet set. Great colors too. "

Sar1,3 months ago,4,"Very well made, but fabric is a little stiffer than previous sheets I e gotten from Costco by the same maker.  Maybe they will soften up after a few more washes. "
David,a year ago,5,Very high quality - better fabric. Extra long flat sheet allows greater tuck in depth while covering the entire mattress. Silky smooth sheets equal better sleep! 
Kenneth,a year ago,5,Love the feel and size of these sheets.  They have a sateen feel and the more than adequate in terms of size.  Best fitting sheets we've ever owned.  Split-King. 
Ljhen14,9 months ago,2,"The sheets feel wonderful after they were laundered five times. They had a disgusting odor . I would have returned them, but I did eventually get the stink out. "
Kiki,3 months ago,5,The Hotel Signature 800 thread sheets are silky and most importantly fit deep mattresses!  This is the first pair of sheets that don’t slip up from the corners.

Breamteam,a year ago,5,Love these sheets. Excellent quality and they are very comfortable and smooth to sleep on. I would recommend this brand to anyone. The sateen finish is perfect.

Mamaw45,11 months ago,4,"These are much cheaper than Sleep Number sheets. They fit a split king Sleep Number. They are smooth, but a little heavy. They will be good for cooler weather. "

Kevin K,4 months ago,4,Hotel sheet set was good quality.  Only thing (and I read this after I purchased) was that the blue is more a blue/green. Otherwise they feel giant look good! 
Sassy,4 months ago,5,These sheets are wonderful. They fit well and are easy to put on because of the elastic. My daughters and I have 10 sets between us. The best we’ve ever used.

MikeyInOregon,a year ago,4,These sheets are solid and of high quality but even with the high thread count and sateen I’m missing the silky feeling that I get from the Kirkland sheets. 
Tyson,8 months ago,3,A little scratchy was my first impression. Not intolerable. Maybe they will get softer with more washings. I like the Kirkland brand better as of right now. 
Joan,6 days ago,5,These are by far the best sheets purchased. No wrinkles and soft but sturdy fabric. Will buy again! 
Strongrr Wind,a year ago,2,"If you use deep pocket corners for your mattress, these sheets won't fit.  The corners are made very differently so only a single 4"" mattress can only fit. "
Nonnie,a year ago,5,Very pleased with the quality of these sheets. The fabric is heavy enough to feel substantial yet the weave is soft and comfortable. We now own three sets. 
Claudia,9 months ago,5,The bottom sheet's deep pockets fit our mattress without any problem.We really like the feel of the sheets and love that it has four king size pillowcases.

C Rod,4 months ago,5,"We’ve been using our new robot toy for 2 months now and have zero complaints. She is consistently hungry and adept at navigating off spaces. Sometimes gets caught in cords on the floor, but she always vocalizes if there’s an issue. I don’t think I would leave her running while I’m out of the house because she does occasionally need a little bit of help. I’ve only used the mop feature work once, but was surprised at how well it worked. The instruction manual is a little vague, and I’ve emailed the company a couple of times to ask questions, and they have been amazingly responsive and informative. I feel like they really stand behind their product. "
GrillDaddy88,7 months ago,5,"This thing is very well done.  Never heard of ECOVACS, but figured if Costco sold it, it had to be good.  Technology has come a long way since I purchased my Roomba over 5 years ago.  This thing has radar on it, maps out your floors, gives you the option of cleaning a specific room, or the whole floor.  Can be scheduled to do so when no one is around.  Is reasonably quiet, and mops, too.  The automatic dust removal vac is the loudest part of the experience and will scare you if you're not expecting it!  Plenty of suction, does a great job cleaning. "
Bullz2010,6 months ago,3,"I purchased a shark and this vacuum. Shark was very intelligent, except that it did not have auto clean function so I purchased this one. When I used it, it would get stuck in different places, and it would need some level of intervention to make it work otherwise it was a very good product, very well packed, beautiful to look at all the good stuff and good app except maybe that algorithm needs more work. I am retuning this will keep shark. (Will miss the auto clean function. Wish Costco had shark with auto clean) "
A10 Fairchild,6 months ago,2,"Here is the thing.  It really has to be online to work.  You can press the button to clean manually, but the default settings according to customer service only allow it to run for up to 20 min., and then it will return to the station.  It won't go back out again.  My robot would not connect to my phone to change any of the default settings. "
Barbara K,9 months ago,5,"Easy to set up, vacuums and mops. My house feels cleaner using this. Quite the timesaver. Quiet and efficient "
Mtsusu,8 months ago,4,"I’m still learning how to run the thing, but it really does a good job working its way through my house. my house may be more complicated with obstacles, it needs my assistance to get unstuck on occasion, and for some reason it wants me to check its wheels. I don’t know what I’m looking for. It seems to be going fine. I would buy it again. "
stogieBill,8 months ago,1,"Maybe I got a defective unit, but it was quite disappointing in everyway I could compare a robot vacuum.  It took forever to charge, it left a trail of dog hair behind it.  I had trouble loading the program on my phone partly because of an error I made in my wifi password but once made it was difficult to correct.  This was our 3rd robot vacuum.  I never used their chat help and they didn't have a phone help. "
Corey,9 months ago,3,There would be 4 stars if there were a bid to empty instead of disposable bags. There would be 5 stars if this didn't appear to be a Costco only model. I've reached out on various platforms to find out which parts and accessories are compatible with this unit but I haven't gotten any responses. Otherwise it sucks like it's supposed to 
Karen,8 months ago,5,My floors are clear of crumbs when it is done! I can walk bare foot and not have any thing stuck to the bottom of my feet. 
Craycrayadorbs,6 months ago,5,"It’s a great machine!  It takes some time to figure out the app and how to create the no mop zones, but it works great!  It has different setting for vacuuming suction.  It got stuck under some furniture after I put on the mop, which it didn’t get stuck before that.  I had to block the furniture with an object so it wouldn’t go under there.  It self empties, I get satisfaction seeing what it picks up lol so I sometimes pause it to look inside.  (Yes I have issues lol). Overall would recommend and would buy again. "
Abhishek,7 months ago,3,Got stuck in multiple places without any barriers 
Sccc,6 months ago,1,Machine don’t go on the base by itself. Do not pick up trash well at all…took it back to the store 
MM_90,5 months ago,4,"After wanting to buy a robot vacuum for years, I finally splurged and bought this one. I felt it was worth the extra cost to have a mop included because I have little kids who spill food and liquids. Overall, I'm happy with this purchase. It is a great vacuum and the app is easy to use. The home mapping feature took multiple attempts before it finally created a baseline map that I could save to the robot's profile. It was frustrating, but once it finally created the area map, it's been great to be able to send it to clean only certain rooms. It does have multi-level mapping, but I haven't figured out how to save the map of my second story. Pros:  1. I haven't picked up a broom in weeks. It is so nice to pull up the app, select the rooms I want cleaned, and then let it run.  2. The auto-empty feature is convenient. Sometimes the dust bin does get too full and then I have to empty it by hand, which probably means I should be running the vacuum more frequently. 3. The vacuum navigates really well around obstacles and is very thorough around chair/table legs. Cons:  1. The mop is just a microfiber cloth that is dragged at the rear of the robot. It doesn't oscillate, vibrate, or rotate as other higher-end robot mops do. So yes it will wipe the floor, but it doesn't make any difference for dried spills or stuck food items. Also, the mop instructions state you shouldn't put any kind of cleaner in it, so you're essentially just wiping with water and not actually cleaning the floor.  2. I have to clean hair out of the main roller brush and its connection points quite frequently. It's not the end of the world, but the vacuum does seem to require more regular upkeep to ensure it operates efficiently. "
OkSana,6 months ago,1,The 1st day it mapped and cleaned well but on the second day I keep trying to start a job and it would start and in a minute of going somewhat in a circle would announce that it needs to empty out and as soon as it’s done it would say it needs to charge.  I figured it was not sitting well and maybe didn’t charge up.   Next day same thing!    So I returned this vacuum literally within one week. 
lMjjj,8 months ago,1,"Piece of crap, I don’t recommend it’s keep saying to clean some censor error, I found out  later online that when there is rust in censor it automatically show that error "
Sud Mallya,5 months ago,1,The vacuum does a poor job of vacuuming and mopping.  And if that wasn’t bad enough the packaging is a nightmare. A large box within another box with multitude of boxes and cardboard within. The maker of this vacuum certainly needs the services of a packaging engineer to reduce the amount of wasteful redundant cardboard in their shipment 
Kate,4 months ago,3,Returning to charge is absolutely a nightmare. Goes all over the place far away but the charging station. Oftentimes repeatedly cleans the same room multiple times. Auto-empty only works when it feels like. So not up to my expectation at this price point. Need to pay more attention to it to make sure it works correctly than my 3 years old vacuum cleaner. Does a decent job of cleaning. Just not smart at all. 
Unicorn poop,5 months ago,1,Robot didn’t pick up small particles like pine needles or food crumbs. It frequently got stuck around the house. We replaced it with an iRobot product and it never gets stuck. 
TCraig,6 months ago,4,"I really needed a robot mop/vac. Our whole house is (pretty much) a light stone floor. I ordered the Ecovac because we had a Costco Shop Card. I had not heard of Ecovac prior to ordering from Costco. Overall, this mop/vac is good. Not great. The set-up was fairly easy. The connection is instant, however, there are no real instructions as to floor mapping, boundaries or floor type. The app is rudimentary. Not super easy to navigate. The cleaning is what is puzzling. We ran it several times in succession and it seems to get hung up on certain things and to ignore normal things. For instance, it went in and out (and in and out, and in and out a million times) under the kitchen table, but when it then had a very clear path through the kitchen floor, it ran up twice and then went right back to the kitchen table. The kitchen floor was not fully cleaned (or at all, really). It was as if it was looking for the most difficult path even though the kitchen is wide open. Overall, I would say that the Ecovac is “good”. Not amazing or cutting edge. It does a decent job on some surfaces which is why I gave it 4 stars. "
Anonymous,11 days ago,1,"I bought this vac when I was staying at an airBNB for 3 months. It started out pretty good; the mapping was fun to watch and it seemed to vacuum pet hair pretty well. The moping was not great at all and leaves streaks. The longer I had it the more I disliked it. I have since moved back home and am constantly yelling at this thing. It gets caught up everywhere, rugs, shoes, every little bump. My Shark and Rumba would just go over these things. It will go in a corner and just continue to run and run and get trapped for no reason. It seldom finds it way back to the docking station. I set up parameters and it sometimes will follow them and sometimes not. Save yourself the aggravation and do not buy this robot. "
bubblegum,7 months ago,5,Fast shipping and the free delivery. Easy to set up and start cleaning my home. 
Mike,5 months ago,1,Never would connect - so haven't used it.  Just sending it back. 
bcsmom,3 months ago,3,"This robot is most efficient if you only ask it to clean one room at a time. On the initial house mapping it cleaned well, we had to do a second map and it didn’t really do a great job. It did seem to clean the carpet better than the hardwood. We have a lot of bare floor in our house so we were hoping this would be a useful tool. I do usually have to go behind it and vacuum a bit. You do also need to keep an eye on it, it can get into trouble if it grabs something it shouldn’t  have. The battery does last for a long time, mine vacuumed for two hours when it mapped the whole house. It does also go and empty its bin as necessary when it’s vacuuming. I haven’t tried the mopping feature yet, so I can’t say how that works. "
JesD,5 months ago,3,"I haven't tried mapping yet, just running manually each day. Also haven't tried mopping yet. It vacuums well, though sometimes had a hard time getting back into the charging station without help. The auto empty feature doesn't appear to work. It gets on the charging station and says it's going to empty. It makes a loud suction noise, but the waste is always still in the receptacle, not in the bag.I will update the review after I've used more features. "
Korean Angel,6 months ago,1,I'm in late 60s' with limited Tech. skills. I live alone and no one to help me with set up. I tried and failed. It was too overwhelming and frustrated. 
mary,6 months ago,5,The ecovac deebot is impressive. It's accuracy   identifying obstacles is precise. Going around legs of chair is very accurate. Runs for a long time on one battery charge. I ran the ecovac for 3 hours and it still had plenty of power left. 
nmpatils,5 months ago,4,"I like this product! We purchased it recently! It supposed to self empty trash, it does make a big sound as if it is going to empty the trash but so far it hasn’t emptied the trash on its own! But besides that it does cleaning very well, it goes under the furniture etc and clean it well! Not too impressed with its mopping ability! The water in the reservoir finishes quickly and only small part of mopping pad touches the floor! I still like this Deebot! It makes cleaning the house easy! I definitely recommend this product! "
Halstead,6 months ago,5,"does a great job, easy to set up on your phone app. recommend if you have dogs to set up to empty more often, can set up also on app. if don't, it will get clogged an not able to empty on its own. "

Morgan,6 months ago,3,Has a hard time docking.  But it quite and does well cleaning. 
Cathy,6 months ago,3,Unable to set app for map cleaning.. 
Jared,2 months ago,3,This vacuum is definitely meant for people without pets or pets that don't shed. The robot worked well on our laminate floors but because of the way the auto-empty station is setup (with 2 holes that suck the dirt out of the bottom of the vacuum) it does not empty well when it comes to hair. I had to empty the bin out manually from the robot most of the time because the hair would just get stuck inside. The mopping feature did work surprisingly well. 
sarah01,2 months ago,4,"Bought to help with dog hair and its doing a pretty good job for tiddy up and regular cleaning. It's not intuitive how to program specific area cleaning. The replacement bags, filters, bridges, etc were hard to find online but then discovered you can use  N10+ bags. This tip will save you frustration looking for them. We don't use the mop feature b/c my husband had to clean the Dyson vacuum which had gunk build-up from moisture. "
Matt,8 months ago,5,Its a good mopping vacuum robot 
Aimz,2 months ago,4,"I love the convenience of setting a schedule for it to vacuum every day. You do have to add the mopping plate when you want it to mop. The emptying of the dust bin is great as i will never have to have dust flying everywhere to empty it. The deebot gets stuck every now and then so i only run this when I'm home. Overall, its been a great addition for our family. "
Anonymous,6 days ago,1,"The entire point of a $500 Robo vac with a canister is so that I don’t have to empty after each cycle.  But this model doesn’t empty into the canister; I have to pick up the vacuum and manually remove the tiny bin and empty it each cycle.  Good luck getting customer service …it’s a bunch of dumb, unhelpful email messages… "
gylc,3 months ago,4,Sometimes it gets stuck in certain anreas otherwise it does its thing.   It doesn’t have any logic going in any order.  I used the mop for a small space and stopped the vac to take off the mop.  Didn’t realize that it only does the mop areas and not the carpet with the mop on.  I would recommend this vac. 
Kyle,5 months ago,3,"Kind of a pain in the a. It's able to map two floors, yet when I move it from one to another, it can't ""locate"" itself. Just now, it took about two hours repeating the same troubleshooting steps before it finally got found. On the bright side, when you don't move it, it works as well as you might expect. "
Johnny The Ice maker,12 days ago,5,"As the title states, this little round wonder has some serious sucking skills. Our floors are clean and very relaxed thanks to the programmable timer. Not a day goes by without our newest family member making the rounds and seeing to the dirt-relieving needs of all of our rooms. "
Pat S,4 months ago,5,This does a great job. So far so good. I decided I would pay a little more than the shark I got that quit after 3 months (highly unusual for a shark product) but didn't want to pay top dollar for some of the other's. Has worked out well and I don't regret paying the extra money. 
JPMadison,2 months ago,1,"I have other robot of same brand and works well, this one is not comparable, it always struggle to find the base, it lose the maps and the accessories are not available even in the official site. I do not recommend the product, it seems like a cheap model designed for Costco. "
Jennifer,2 months ago,2,"Bought this because of the reviews - it filled up within 3 vacuum sessions and no replacement bags.  Also, the mop does NOT do a good job and barely puts out any water when put on the highest output level.  I am returning this.  Trying just the iRobot j8 instead. "
Tatha,5 months ago,4,This is a good product and works for multi floors. I like the battery life and how it cleans. Only drawback is that has a bin bag in the auto empty area. The bin bag is small and difficult to clean. 
Diane,a month ago,3,I bought this vacuum  for the self emptying feature and the mop feature. Unfortunately it doesn't self empty well or mop well. It vacuums very well

Lauraflies,4 years ago,3,"This is good.  I was worried that the green garbage container might be too small, but it isn't.  This can is taller than my last ones.  It hold more volume than I expected.  To throw away a cantaloupe you would have to cut it in half, but then you should be eating it not throwing it away.  It's cool it has a finger hole with grabbers to secure the garbage bag. I am giving it 3 stars because when the bags are in it can be tricky to get the containers to fit correctly into place.  Sometimes one or the other wants to be slightly higher, and then the lid doesn't want to close.  It's not so bad.  I decided to keep it.  I'd give it 3.7 on a star rating. "
MLSB,3 years ago,2,"This is a nice looking trash/recycling container, and we thought it would work well for us. The recycling is rather small so fills up quickly, but we didn't mind. We liked this product until the soft close started malfunctioning within a week or two. After the lid opened, it wouldn't close all the way. There wasn't anything we could do to close it, so we just had to wait until it decided to close on its own. We would spend time opening it multiple times in hopes that it would close. We could step on the opener, and the lid would open all the way, but then it would only partially close. We decided to return it. "
Luis,3 years ago,4,"This recycle and trash bin was a great upgrade from the two plastic bins we used before. The trash side is surprisingly spacious with standard 13 gallon kitchen bags fitting with plenty of space. The feature to hold the bag in place is also a nice touch. The recycling bin on the other hand, is a little small and would be best served for cans and bottles. Boxes or bigger containers don't fit and end up next to the bin until taken out. The one I received had a small dent on the side from transport, not a huge deal but worth noting.  Overall, great premium look and feel for a recycle and trash bin. "
Morgan,5 years ago,3,"Love the dual bins and for half the price of the expensive brand!  I do have some things I don’t like about it, but I’m keeping it because it gets the job done for the price I want to spend.  The first concern I have is that the recycling bin is rather small so I have to use small bags in it and change them often.  I also don’t like the clearance between the lid and the bins; there’s not much room and sometimes the bags on the bins overflow for that reason and can be seen when the lid is shut.  Furthermore, the bins need a little wiggling to get into the correct place for the lid to even completely shut.  My last complaint would be that the lid gets dirty easily, and tends to look like it has scratches on it, however I’ve been able to get it to look decent by cleaning with a microfiber cloth. "
Vmrao,3 years ago,1,"Got this because it had both recycling and trash containers in one which seemed like a great idea. However we were disappointed with the design. The two plastic containers are crammed inside very tightly and there is no way to keep the trash bag in place. There are no markings to show the proper way to fit the two containers, and the lid doesn't close properly unless you do everything with surgical precision. Too much work for a trash can. We really wanted to keep this, but the negatives outweighed the positives for us and we will be returning it. "
Laura,a year ago,2,"We bought this three years ago for the first time. Within a year, we ended up sending it back because the hydraulic element began popping out and the lid began slamming shut. We were able to get a replacement sent to us (and we had to ship the old one back, prepaid but still a pain). Within 1.5 years of receiving a new one, it happened again. We tried numerous fixes but we will be trying something new rather than trying to replace this one.  Additionally, the trash can is very tall and narrow, so while it is 13gal, a standard trash bag does not reach the bottom which has led to numerous messy situations over the years. "
SusiC,4 years ago,5,"This is well made and reliable, unlike the battery operated SS can that ate up my batteries constantly. One of the two interior bins is small but I have more recycling than trash so it works for me. This would not be big enough for a family, this is for a two person max household due to the two bins being on the smaller side. Initially the pedal was a bit stiff, but it eventually loosened up and lifts easily.  I highly recommend this trash bin. "
Jeff,4 years ago,1,"Extremely poor design.  As others have said, the foot pedal mechanism breaks for no reason, even with less than average use.  Mine broke after a couple months.  I have spent the last 3 months in communication with the manufacturer trying to get them to fix or replace it.  No luck.  They are aware of the design flaw and do nothing about it.  Their 5 year warranty is absolutely useless.  Spend your money elsewhere.  I wish I could get my $100 back and buy something else.  Instead I have broken trash can. "
Frank C,3 years ago,1,"We had this for almost a year but somehow one day, the opening and closing assist mechanism stops working and now it opens and closes with a loud bang from hitting the wall when it opens and slams it back to itself when it shuts.  The noise is loud like the percussion instrument!!!!   In addition, the recycling compartment is too small for any family size.  We are a family of 4 and the container doesn't last a day from bottles, plastic, etc....   In my estimation, it probably can only a few plastic bottles, plastic fruit containers, maybe a wine bottle.  Not practical at all. "
Sanjune,4 years ago,1,I bought this in November last year and was satisfied with the product till now. We are a 2 people household and the use has been sparing. But I am very disappointed that lid opening mechanism broke this week for no apparent reason. Now this is like any other simple trash can. Hoping Costco would arrange for a replacement. 
Anonymous,4 years ago,3,"The product is nice however the description of the product isn't accurate. description mentioned that the bin was ""Fingerprint-Resistant Brushed Stainless Steel"" - however that is hardly the case. During the very first use I realized that there were finger print marks left all over the bin and that isnt what I had imagined when i was buying the product.  Will I buy this product again - that seems unlikely. For the price I paid, I believe I can get a better deal and would trust a product that is accurate to its description. However, the return would be a hassle so I have kept the product. "
Richard,4 years ago,2,"Can arrived in great shape. No blemishes. Looks good. But hinge broke after a few weeks. I was unable to reach anyone at Costco 800# to try and replace can without going through the hassle of repurchasing online and returning to store for credit. I called 4 times and each time was told the wait to speak to a person would be from 55 to 70 minutes! Come on Costco! Twice I was given the option of a callback and none ever came. I sure expect better service from Costco ,especially at a time when I and so many others are buying online. "
Melinda52,5 years ago,5,Great garbage can! So much more convienent to have both trash and recycle in same can. It is fingerprint resistant as stated but it's constucted to there's no reason to touch it except when empying the bins. 
NCca,5 years ago,3,It looks and fits well in the intended space but it’s very difficult to keep the trash bag in place on the trash side. Most of dual containers I’ve seen have an extra lip to hold the bag in place. I’m keeping it but wouldn’t purchase it all over again. 
liz5,3 years ago,4,"I have been using this trash can for a few months now and it is perfect for my apartment of two! The charcoal filter in the top does a great job of eliminating any odor. Removing and reinserting the bins in place takes a few tries and some getting used to, but we have gotten the hang of it after a while. The 13 gallon trash bags we use in the trash compartment are a little bit large, so I appreciate the hole near the top to hold the excess lining tight. The lid lock can be difficult to slide open and closed, but I hardly ever need to use it. The plastic base keeps it in place without it scratching the floor. Love the look and enjoy being able to keep trash and recycling in one place! "
Jake,3 years ago,2,The 2 stars are for exterior look and concept. I wanted this to work and tried it out for a couple weeks. I thought it was a great idea since I always have a small pile of recyclables on my kitchen island and take out to recycle bin at the end of the day. This bin doesn't have enough space to fit both sections with a liner because the lid then does not properly close and even if I was willing to use without a liner (gross) the bins don't properly seat themselves in the can and again the lid does not properly close. 
MaryMaryCA,5 years ago,5,"I've been shopping for this type of can for a while. Much more expensive in other places. I was worried that neither container would be big enough. The recycling compartment is a little small, but it's also pretty tall. The construction seems very solid. To make this 100% perfect, the company would offer to sell a trash-only plastic container that fits this dual can also. "
Djambazoff,4 years ago,1,"The product itself is of a good quality. The functional design, however does need improvement. When the bigger bin is half full, the back side of the bin hits the closing mechanism, and the top cover doesn't fully close. "
Paul,4 years ago,1,Hinge for the door is not durable at all 
Sweet Dreams,4 years ago,1,"It broke three months after I purchased it, now the lid doesn’t close! "
Mike,5 years ago,3,The intention was good but the 18L side is just a little to small for either recycling or trash. Both inserts fit tight so adding a bag and keeping it in place is difficult. 
Handyaroundthehouse,4 years ago,4,"We has a stainless steel lift-lid trash can in the kitchen we've used for years.  It is sturdy, attractive, and easy to open.  For small recycle we has a separate container we placed on the floor.  On the plus side this new product has both a trash and a bin for recycle that makes our kitchen space less cluttered and is till attractive. On the down side is the lid mechanism seems flimsier than our first one.  I is plastic with  metal inlay for appearance and the foot lever requires much more force and works more slowly.  This concerns me because of the stresses this one puts on plastic parts.  I'm not as confident in the long term wear.  However, it does work well and as I said, really makes our kitchen space neater. "
Mary,4 years ago,1,3 months old and already broken. 
paperpusher,4 years ago,5,"It took me while before writing this. I had to find bags to fit the smaller side which I did on a large online retail site. I also wanted to give it a bit of time. Our initial foray into using the bag clip which my grandkids pointed out was clumsy. But with the second go round, I found that if you pull the drawstring a bit snug it helps to lock the bag under the edges then you can twist and stuff any leftover bag though the clip. The second time around there was much less extra. We're loving the separate compartments for the garbage and recycling in one can. No more recycling bag hanging on the back door knob(hubby's idea). As far as not showing fingerprints, it really doesn't show much and an easy wipe will remove them quickly. We love the lock on the lid which is necessary to install the bag without holding the lid up. This is the first garbage can we've had with a foot pedal and we love it. I only wish is that it had come with some trial bags so use could start immediately. "
Veronica,3 years ago,3,"I bought this because I have very little space in my kitchen and thought it would be good for recycling and trash. The trash can itself is so nice and sturdy. It is quality but it's hard to get the bags in AND have the lid close all the way, which really isn't a big problem. I want to love this but I just don't think it was a good fit for me. I even tried switching sides since I seem to a lot of recyclables. I still ended up using two trashcans. I probably should have bought the single bin version. If you have little recycling or waste, this would be a good purchase. "
Tina,5 years ago,4,"Price is right, scratches and marks easily,  so time will tell. The weight of the lid for a step pedal might become a problem if mechanism is plastic inside . As advertised. Easy to empty and clean. May not be durable. We’ve had it 2 months I would have preferred to have paid more for a better made product.  Keeping it "
Mathqueen19,4 years ago,1,We found that the recycling bin is way too small and fills up so quickly that there's no point having this trash can since we recycle judiciously. Good concept but didn't work for us! 
Kathy,3 years ago,5,"The Neocube is exactly what I needed. The measurements are perfect for the space I have. It looks clean and sleek and I like the hands-free pedal feature. You can choose which of the lightweight interior containers will contain garbage and which is recycle (one is larger), line the garbage one with a bag and just carry the recycle one to your outside bin on trash day. It took me a few minutes to get the side-by-side interior containers to slide back in and settle into the container so the lid would close properly, but in short time I got the hang of it. "
jt1929,5 years ago,5,"As advertised, at half the price of the market leader. Both sides slide out vertically. There's a latch to hold the lid open. Seems solid. "
TDel,4 years ago,2,"This trashcan might work in a single person's home. However, even two people produce too much trash and recycling for this product. I am a mother with 2 small children and I was taking out the trash every other day. Also, the recycling bin is inadequate for gallons of milk or jugs or juice. "
Phony,2 years ago,4,"I received my first purchase only to find a large dent on side of can.  Returned and reordered. I received my second can only to discover a smaller dent on the lid. Still, this is an expensive can.   While the company does ship in two boxes, the first box is so thin, it’s more like a thin sheet of cardboard with no styrofoam.  I immediately contacted Costco regarding another replacement or a price adjustment.  Many days later, I received an email from Keith at Costco indicating I’ve contacted the incorrect division of Costco for my inquiry!  I requesting that Keith please forward my issue to the correct party and I’ve never received a response from Costco until this review request! "
anthdancer,4 years ago,1,"the items looks fancy but the hinge the allows the lid to open and close is made of plastic and after 7 months it cracked and then the plastic starts to fall apart, rending the lid useless "
Andrea F,4 years ago,1,"This trash bin was great...until it started to slam - just 2 months after we got it.  I tried to see if I could fix the issue but could not see what the issue is, and they have no manual on their website.  Very frustrating. "
Clickhere4dawn,5 years ago,5,"The best trash can, having a place for recycling is the most sensible solution. Wish I would have bought years ago. "
Cin3,2 years ago,1,I wish this works better. It was husbands idea so we can have both recycled and trash in one but the size of the trashcan it's different than the trash bags and it was more a waste of trash bag and it's not really easy to put the trash bags.Sorry. 
Dizzyl,5 years ago,5,"Love the convenience of both cans in one place, keeps the area clean.the soft close! "
Ashley N,5 years ago,4,"Great trash can, came quickly and in great condition. Only thing I don't like is that it's a bit tedious to get the individual canisters in and out, maybe with practice it won't be so bad. Easy to wipe clean. "
MissB,3 years ago,1,"We bought this because it has separate compartments for trash and recyclables, and it might work well if we didn't want to put bags in to line the trash bin.  Unfortunately, we find it gross to not line our trash bin, so this is not an option.  Adding a trash bag is extremely difficult, and once we do get one in place, ut is then impossible for the lid to close fully.  This results in an unsightly, partially open trash can at all times.  Definitely would not recommend or purchase again. "
leah,4 years ago,3,hard to put the two bins back in to fit snuggly in order to close the lid 
Wine lover,4 years ago,4,"Great to have one trash can for recycles & garbage.  I tried the battery operated trash can & it drove me crazy.  It opened whenever I walked by & stayed open often when I used it.  I much prefer the step.Pros: 2 compartments, step, appearanceCons: trash bags don’t stay well, especially on the smaller can; the cans don’t go in easily - must be lined up perfectly or the lid won’t close; the cans are smaller than I’d like but they need to be or the container would be too large. "
Max D,3 years ago,4,"Overall really good combo trash/recycle bin. Very happy with it. It is small though, and the dimensions are listed incorrectly. The actual product width and depth are about 2 inches less than what is listed. Hight is correct. So be prepared for that. You will also go through trash bags much quicker and more often. "
Kelli,2 years ago,4,"Great price. Good size, touchless lid is nice. I wish the lid opened a full 90 degrees - I have to hold it to get the internal bins in and they’re a bit tricky to get in straight so that lid closes sometimes but just takes a few wiggles to get them to sit right. These aren’t deal breakers for me but might be for folks with mobility issues. I really like the the little notch in each compartment to secure a trash bag.  Overall a good alternative to more expensive products. "
Mocha,3 years ago,4,As of 1/4/2021 Have used trash can for roughly 1 week. So far working very well. It can be a little tricky to get the individual bins into the main bin but after using it a few days I got the hang of it - husband still struggling but that's no surprise. Doesn't hold a lot of trash even for 2 people but I wouldn't want anything larger in my kitchen. It's adequate for our needs. Foot control to open lid works well but we'll see in the next 6 months if it's still working dependably - I WOULD HOPE SO! There is a small lid lock that holds the lid open when removing and replacing the individual bins which is a nice feature. Also like the 2 colored individual bins. Green for recycle and black for garbage. I would recommend this product. 
erika,2 years ago,3,"the trash can itself is decent.  though, its a bit too small for our needs.  ended up buy a new trashcan and using this one for 'regular' recyclables and 'cans/bottle' recyclables. "
Anonymous,4 years ago,4,"Great trash/recycling can.  Looks great in our kitchen and was a welcome replacement after having a plastic can before.  Both bins are slim and compact so they will need to be emptied more frequently depending on how fast your family generates waste.  Lock comes in handy when tidying the kitchen, making dinner, or taking out and replacing either bin. *Product had a dent in the steel when unboxed even though the box showed no damage. Costco would have refunded it, but I was able to push it back to normal with minimal effort, and it will surely suffer worse from daily use, so it wasn't worth the trouble. That is the only reason for one less star because it may have been packed that way or handles roughly before Costco even shipped it. "
Marisela,3 years ago,4,"I like my new trash can so farI really needed something like it for separation of recyclables from regular trashI am not giving it a 5 ⭐️ just because it’s challenging to make the inside bins to go in perfectly and not obstruct the lid, the edge of them are not regular they have a special shape and i think The best way learned has been pulling both out and letting them in perfectly even down at the same time, which doesn’t work if one of the bins has already something in it and obviously not all trash bags will fill up evenly with each other "
Fourjps,5 years ago,2,"The garbage can itself is great and works well in use. The problem is that the separate compartments need to be put in just right in order for the lid to close and takes some maneuvering. The bins are an odd size and to find bags that fit properly is difficult. Too big of bags compound the problem of the bins fitting in correctly. Great looking and wonderful in concept, but doesn't work for me and my family. "
Kandace,3 years ago,4,"It is super pretty. Good size. After using for a week, the foot pedal never opened the lid fully (was always at like 45-60 degrees) and squeaked a lot but may have just been an issue with mine or because it's new. Loved the slow close feature and I liked the knob to hold it open. I decided to return and a different one mainly due to opening issue and size. I'm a solo female so for a family, I'm not sure "
James,4 years ago,1,"I wish I could give 0 stars. My wife and I purchased this can approximately a year ago and began having issues with the sensor by the fourth month. Occasionally we could get it working correctly, but eventually, the sensor light would consistently pulse and the lid became non-functional.  We attempted to contact the manufacturer directly, which was what they preferred, but we were told a replacement lid would not be delivered for a month or two. When I asked for an update, I was told it would be longer than 3 months. We decided we could not go 1/4 of a year without a trash can lid and decided we will not be buying one of these again. Frankly put, don’t buy this automated can. Do the extra work by pushing your foot down on a manual lid... we thought this was a great feature, but in reality, convenience sometimes comes at a great cost. Poor customer service. Terrible product. Avoid! "
Tiny Tim,4 years ago,3,"I bought this about a month ago, I did return this and bought the single 50 L model. The duel model did not hold enough rubbish or recycling, we are a two person household. Another thing I was not a fan of was how cumbersome getting the bags in and keeping the lid closed. I DID like the elegant look and the size of this Trashcan. I JUST Kept my recycling can next to this one. Hope this review helps. "
Nylor,3 years ago,4,"So far, I really like the -Neocube...Stainless Steel Trash Bin. It is very sturdy and it looks very nice in the kitchen. If I could change anything- I would like for the top to be removable in order that I can thoroughly clean all the crevices of the can. I am adamant about keeping a clean trash can and sometimes they get food product on them that may fall/spill in the cracks.  Because of this there could be odor created due to food which is  why I would want the top to be removable for deep cleaning. Other than that it is a great trash bin. "
Libster,3 years ago,5,"This trash can works well in my smaller space and has a nice look. It's very convenient having both the trash & recycling in one. The top has a slow-closure so it doesn't bag down. This also has a little slide that will keep the top open, like while emptying a bin or changing the bag. It's a little tricky getting the separate containers to sit all the way down into the bottom, but I have only had this about a week so am still learning. And this likely would not be a good choice for a larger family because it is small. So far, very happy. "
Rose F,2 years ago,2,"It’s extremely small if there’s more than just you using it. It’s terribly wasteful of bags. When the can is full and you pull out the bag, there’s still a lot of space left for more trash. The two cans don’t go in together kindly once you’ve taken them out and you have to finagle it several times to get the lid to close. This was a very disappointing purchase and not worth the money. "
Matt,4 years ago,3,"Decent, but not sure if I’d spend this much on garbage can again. Wish these things would be designed to be ant proof at the very least. That and the two little compartments take some fussing with to get them to sit right so the kid will close. Overall it works and it’s main features function fine. But $100+ for a garbage can should have a little extra umph in my opinion. "
Anonymous,4 years ago,5,This dual compartment trash can works great for me. The opening and closing foot pedal mechanism is convenient and very useful. I am using a standard 13gallon kitchen liner bag in the larger bin because that's what I had on hand. At some point I may switch to better fitting bag. My only gripe is that there is no recommendation for bags with this product. 
Ryan B,4 years ago,4,"Love the purchase, however it is not toddler proof. It may be ""smudge proof"" but I am not sure what my child has smeared all over it. Maybe I expected Minions to jump out and clean it after he touches it. There is a door inside the lid to put some type of deodorizer, which I would have thought it would have included one with the purchase. "
Caitlin,a year ago,4,"Great little compact unit, soft close, open lock, does a great job at containing most odors. My only real gripe is that the recycling canister doesn't hold much the main garbage canister is 2 gallons short of a standard 13gal bag, so you never fully fill the bag before it's time to take it out. Other than that, no complaints. "
Jeremy E,4 years ago,5,"This is a great all-in-one solution for trash and recycling.  Shipping was quick (despite everything going on in the world right now) and the box is reinforced to prevent damage.  We had initial concerns about the size of both containers, but after a couple weeks of use we haven't noticed any uptick or complaints about trash/recycle drops to the outside can. Both cans have holes to hold the trash bags in so they don't slip.  The can looks great next to our metal water cooler that was purchased at a warehouse location. "
CWall,10 months ago,1,I had this for 2 1/2 years then the raising mechanism broke.  I ordered another one as it fits perfectly in the space in my kitchen.  The new one arrived dented.  The replacement arrived with 2 dents.  I am now waiting for the 3rd one to be delivered.  The outer cartons are intact so they are being packed damaged. 
smartin,2 years ago,3,"I purchased this trash can a little more than a year ago.  Some reviewers complained about the small bins, but as a single person, the small bins make sure I take out the trash more than once a week.  There's a small hole in each bin where you can push through the liner giving it a snug fit.  While the bins need to be set in just right, I can see how some folks get frustrated.  I just figured out the right way to set them in and have no trouble.  Unfortunately, the lift mechanism broke off.  There's a metal piece that you can reach through the back of the can but it snapped right off and without a welding machine, it can't be reattached.  I will be returning the can to Costco.  Not sure if I want to replace it with another one.   Though, i really liked it before it broke. "
Kierstyn,3 years ago,3,"Overall I didn’t have any issues with the product itself, other then fussing with the bins to get them to sit right so the lid would close correctly. I live in a house with 3 adults for reference. The containers were small and fill up very quickly, but the bags (13 gallon) I was using would still have a good amount of room in them. So my trash bag would be sitting out side of the can half the time until I topped it off, which defeated the purpose. I ended up returning it and getting 2 separate regular sized cans. "
Kchats,3 years ago,4,I like this trash bin a lot. It was what I was looking for with both trash and recycling. We downsized so this fits the bill. I find the bag a little hard to get on properly and back into the bin for the trash side but that might be a user issue!  It also arrived with a small dent but I opted not to return it. My husband didn’t even notice. Costco has such an excellent return policy I thought I would live with it a bit and see if it bugs me. Overall I would recommend this trash bin. It looks great in my kitchen. 
Working Mom,3 years ago,4,I bought this in Nov 2020 - it is now May 2021 and the lid suddenly stopped closing gently and now slams shut. It looks as if the bar that helps with the process is bent now. Not sure if it's fixable. Seems like it should have lasted longer. Otherwise looks great and was really functional. 
bonnie,10 months ago,3,"I love the concept of trash and recycling in one bin.  The con is that there are NO bags to easily fit in this bin.  the 13 gallon are too large for the trash side, and the 8 gallon too small.  The recycle side is also impossible to find.  It is a struggle to put in liners for this bin. "
Rachel,9 months ago,1,"This came in the mail with a dent on it, so easily damageable. It was difficult to put a trash bag in the trash compartment. Also trash can rarely closes all the way. I returned this and got the simple human dual trash can. Simple human trash can was the same price in store. "
Anonymous,4 years ago,3,"Serves the purpose of keeping them separate, but not easy to replace bags, and for a family, it is a bit small.  Hinge is on the outside, which when placed against a wall/counter, it leaves a mark from opening and closing.  Otherwise, it's a garbage can and works. "
Kris B,9 months ago,5,Had been eyeing a dual trashcan for a while. This one is a great size and looks nice. Like the inside has holes to tighten the bags through. Soft lid closure. Def recommend if looking for a trash can like this. Came fast and well packaged from Costco. 
Anonymous,4 years ago,5,Great trash can! Originally wanted the simple human version of this but this is definitely a much more affordable alternative. Might not be good for a family though as the compartments are small. Would recommend for a single person or couple. 
Tristen,3 years ago,3,"Not as great as i was hoping, but functional for trash and recycle. The compartments especially the recycle bin area is super small for items we throw away. We still end up with bigger items off to the side or on the counter til we take them out. Feels like im wasting space in my trash bags since theyre not compeltely full when we take them out. Other than that the trash can works good so far after a few months no issues, love that the lid has a latch that holds it open when cooking cleaning etc. "
sodafanes,10 months ago,2,Minor dents on the upper edge of the buddy. The lid doesn't close evenly. Be careful pushing down the foot pedal any other area than in the middle. Mine broke on the third day because I was pressing down on the sides. 
Dan E,4 years ago,4,This is a great dual trash can. I love the slow close lid and the dual cans.  My only wish is that the inserts were a little bigger and you have to make sure they’re inserted properly for the lid to close. 
Jessica,5 years ago,4,Looks great.  Similar to more expensive brands in appearance. However the raising mechanism is pretty slow and feel like it will not hold up long term.  Overall very happy with the purchase though. 
Judy,4 years ago,1,Can't use  bags in the inserts So we are going to take out the inserts and buy bigger bags and just use it as a garbage can instead of both recycling and garbage as it was design to do 
Joseluis,3 years ago,2,"It’s not very practical. There are not plastic bags that fit properly these bins. All of them are too big and it’s difficult to put them in. And if you don’t use any, it gets very messy. "
JulesBinSF,3 years ago,3,"The bin is well made, nicely finished, and the internals work nicely, but it gets a 3 star for usability. The lid is quite heavy duty, and so you have to press quite hard on the opening pedal to open fully, which moves the bin. You can't just quickly pop it open like other brands I've tried. Also, locking it open is clunky and requires both hands because you have to push the lid wide open (the pedal doesn't cut it) then manually move the catch to hold the lid. I might still return it. "
A2AK,2 years ago,2,This is great trash can but the spring in the lid (that keeps it from slamming shut) broke shortly after we bought it….got a replacement and the spring just went on the new one too 
joseph jd,5 years ago,4,Not easy to step and open. It is spacious and elegant. I prefer just to recycle and put the trash separately. Of course now that I have it I am going to use it. 
SaffronFox,a year ago,5,"It’s the perfect size for my needs, I really like it’s height. I’m currently using one side for trash and the other compost, and I am so happy about this kitchen upgrade. I’ve added a carbon sheet inside the trash vent but I think I may do the whole lid like my previous trash (I ordered a sheet online). I wish somehow the compartments were interchangeable but it’s not, and that’s fine. We actually very much enjoy this trash can, the stainless steal blend well with general look. "
Loren,4 months ago,3,Nice look but its hard to put the plastic  cans back in you need to move them around to get in there spot it not that easy or the lid wont go all the way down 
CostcoShopperMom,4 years ago,5,"This can gave us the capacity to go a week without having to Empty to the recyclable bin. It used to take us multiple Trips each day. Nice looking, sturdy! "
Elsie,a year ago,5,This is a well-made trash cash and clever in design. It stays in place. I'm very happy to finally have my recycling and trash consolidated into one place. 
tvbn,4 years ago,4,Love how I have one can for both recycling and garbage. Anything else similar to this is much more expense. Rated 4 stars because it scratches easily. 
Janette,4 years ago,1,Do yourself a favor and buy two regular cans. The tiny side for recycling is redundant. Plus you can't easily put bags in them. I returned to Costco. 
CFoster,5 years ago,4,Nice can with regular and recycle bins. Just wish it was a little bigger. The step on/ open function is a little hard to get open all the way. 
Edgar,3 years ago,5,It fills up quickly but keeps the kitchen organized regarding recycling. Better than the prior product I got from Costco and sturdier 
KarenP,3 years ago,4,Works well! Good for one container with one side for trash and another for recycling. Wish the recycling side was a little bigger. 
Cindy,4 years ago,1,Worst garbage can ever. Bags dont fit. Hard to put cans back in..too small...frustrated every time I empty it. 
SnowCat,3 years ago,4,I like the design and quality. Not quite big enough. Recycling is only picked up twice a month here.

Julie,3 years ago,2,"We were happy with the overall size of the receptacle for the two of us. We didn’t like that it scooted slightly every time you opened it so it eventually ended up against the wall. The lid never opened all the way and you had to keep your foot on the pedal to keep it open. It apparently came damaged because when I picked it up to move it for mopping under, the bottom collar/feet came off in pieces. Returned after less than two weeks using it. "
Venkey,3 years ago,4,"Ideal for a small family, the bins are little smaller than I thought but I like how compact it is in our kitchen. They are easy to clean and the stainless steel look is great. I observed that the two containers are so close and snug to each other that it is difficult to take one out without removing the other one. It is also difficult to find a perfect liner to match them the 8 gallon ones are too small and 13 gallon bags are just too big. "
Maria,3 years ago,3,Pros: Great to have the separate bins for trash and recyclables. Reasonable price. Looks great in kitchen with stainless finish.Cons: Loud “bang” each time the lid shuts and my putting felt pads on outer lid lip doesn’t minimize that loud “bang” - loud enough to wake the baby napping in our open concept living/kitchen. Body easily dented (came with small body dent in shipping but I needed it and didn’t have time to wait for replacement). 
Jenni L,3 years ago,2,"I love the idea of having separate recycling and trash bins in one place, but if you’re a family of more than two people this trash can is just not practical. I found myself having to take the trash out more than once a day because the compartments are so small. The bags are also really hard to stay put since the compartments are so tight in the can. It’s a great idea, but definitely not worth spending almost $100. I’ll be returning. "
Lynn,4 years ago,3,Much as I thought this was a gereat idea I find it alost impossible to get trash bags to fit these weird sized bins. If you try any of the cinch sack types they'll be too short as well as too wide. Once you get the bins with ill fitting bags back into the can you'll find it difficult to get the thing to close and the bags spill out from under the front. I'd return it but need trash receptacles so ... I definitely would not recommend 
Jill,8 months ago,2,"I really wanted to like this product. It was a nice size, I love the idea of combining my trash and recycling for a smaller footprint. The containers were so snug that when I tried to put a can liner in, they didn't seem to fit right. I struggled to get the individual containers in and out. My normal Costco liners also seemed oversize for the trash container. As much as I wanted to keep it, we knew it wouldn't be functional for us. "
Bob27,a year ago,3,"It is small. The trash can works, for a house of two. For those with a bigger household (which are most), you will probably find this too small depending on how much waste/recycle you produce. Recycle portion can barely anything larger than plastic/glass bottles. It is a little awkward to pull the cans in and out to empty/replace bags but is manageable. All together, it looks nice on the outside and functions well, as a trash can. "
Kimberly,3 years ago,4,"The opening pedal is a little “soft”, but it does open and close as advertised.  My only change would be equal sized containers.  I use the larger container for recycling, due to a higher amount of recycling, leaving the “trash” side just a tad small.  You also have to make sure each container is properly lined up in order for the lid to close completely.  Both containers have the little grabby hole to secure a trash bag. "
E Gray,3 years ago,5,"Excellent product. Super satisfied with it especially for the price paid. Decent capacity for both compartments, nice soft close, seems to contain smells well. I like that each compartment lifts out so you aren't having to squeeze the bag out each time. Both compartment also have a little hole to pull the bag through so that it get nice and snug and tucks in easily so the bag isn't visible from the outside of the bin. "
Oreo4433,3 years ago,5,"We recycle everything but I was always tired of cans, bottles and paper sitting on my kitchen counter to take out to the recycle bin. Seeing this on the Costco website I knew I had to buy it. I love that it is both garbage and recycle in one. I didn’t want to have to separate garbage cans sitting in my kitchen. The two compartments are the perfect size. Great quality and looks nice. It also has a slow closing lid. "
Ragtops42,3 years ago,2,"I purchased this product on-line on 6/26/20.  I'm giving the product 2 stars because I did like having the 2 different bins to separate recyclables from garbage.  The lid completely broke off of the can after 6 months of normal use.  I conclude that the lid is too heavy for the hinge mounting, cracked, and went unnoticed until it fell off. My expectations were that this product would last longer than 6 months. "
Settled1,3 years ago,4,"I’m happy with this dual bin garbage can. It’s what I needed for the space I have. I prefer keeping my garbage bin under the sink, but considering I can’t do that, this is an attractive alternative. My only minor complaint is how difficult it is to get the bags to fit in each bin and then settle in…the bins have a tight fit. I struggle to get everything to settle in, but once I do, it’s ultra convenient! "
F54soccer,3 years ago,2,"This is a very nice trash can, however the bins are a bit small for our family of two.  The cans are tricky to get seated in the bins. The soft close feature is very nice, however the soft close feature broke in less than 3 months, so we will be returning this trash can to Costco and considering another can for our purchase. We wanted to love it, but with no soft close, it’s off to the return pile. "
BB09,2 years ago,2,The concept is good but the interior sizes are too small. The recycle would not fit but maybe 3-4 empty gallon of milk. The other one is not that much bigger. What I wish is to have two compartments. One holds 13 gallons for recycle and the other holds 6-7 gallons for trash as we do not have much trash due to the garbage disposal being used during the winter and compose during the other months. 
Greg,3 years ago,2,"Never did get the lid to completely seal when closed even after readjusting both liners.  Liners must be oriented correctly, but even then the lid is uneven leading to odors to escape. The recycle side is nearly useless as it fills up with little usage.  Most of our recycle is plastic and cardboard and this small liner fills up so fast its nearly useless.  Great idea, just needs to be bigger. "
Gabby,4 years ago,5,"This has been a great trash can. It was half the price of the comparable Simple Human cans of this size at the same quality. The bins are easy to remove, but we ended up using the black side for recycling because we filled the smaller green side too quickly. Our only complaint - we have had a hard time finding Eko's deodorizers for the top compartment and some generic ones are a bit too big. "
SSundar,4 years ago,4,"Good finish - but the recycle bin is too small. We bought this for the convenience of having trash and recycle in one single place and while it does serve that purpose, the recycle side of it is too small to hold even a few milk cans and a couple of cartons. We have now adapted to this and are trying to crush the cans before putting in to make space, but not always easy. Otherwise 5 stars. "
Opinions R Free,5 years ago,2,"Bins didn't line up properly/easily, was like a bad game of Tetris. That caused the lid to stay open which is a deal breaker. It came with no paperwork so no clue on what size, brand or type of odor packets to put in the slot. Didn't resist many fingerprints and the stepper is plastic and metal but feels flimsy. Also it slightly dented from my toe so I assume it won't take abuse from kids. "
Frased,8 months ago,1,We bought this trash can in June 2022 and it has not been the most practical due to its size and accommodating much recycling after only a couple of bottles/cans. And this week the mechanicals for the lid just gave out and it now closes shut with a big bag and hard.  I plan to return it as it was not inexpensive.  I like the idea of one can for trash and recycling but this doesn't work. 
Karen808,4 years ago,2,"Interior bins are too small, plus if you use a counter-top green waste bucket (as I do), having the green waste bin inside the refuse can is a waste. I got rid of the interior bins and use a standard tall white kitchen trash can inside of the can instead. It doesn't fit perfectly, but well enough to be usable for trash. And I have a open tall white trash can next to it for recyclables. "
SallyMae,2 years ago,1,This can WAS NOT on display in Costco store so bought online blindly. We regret this purchase. POOR DESIGN. Its a pain to put the trash bag in the garbage section. Its does not stay no matter how hard you try (even pushing through the star like holes provided). The bag falls into the can constantly. And recently the lid makes a crashing loud noise when closed. VERY Dissapointing. 
NDickson,3 years ago,3,"I have been looking for a garbage can like this with recycling for a while. I bought it when it went on sale. I like it, but I don't love it.  Pros: -Side by side garbage and recycling in the same trash can-You are still able to use a 13 gallon trash bag. There is a hole in both containers that you an put the excess bag in so the lid will still shut.-Good price Cons: -It is definitely not brushed stainless steel, or fingerprint resistant. It's more of a shiny stainless steel, and I wipe fingerprints off the lid daily. I have kids, so I'm assuming for an adult, there wouldn't be so many fingerprints because with the foot pedal, you don't actually have to touch the lid. -You really have to step down on the foot pedal with some pressure to get the lid to open all the way. With that said, I'm still going to keep it because it does the job, and is a good value. Not sure I would recommend or purchase again. "
Lauren,5 years ago,4,"Love the idea and okay of the trash/recycle can. Like most of the reviews mentioned its a little smaller than I hoped. Figuring out what way to put the trash or recycle compartment back in can be tricky, if it is not 100% right it doesn't close all the way. I got it on sale for $80, so I am happy with the product at this price. Would not pay full price for this thought. "
Wango Tango,3 years ago,4,"I love this trash can - all-in-one as I expected. It's sleek and attractive (compared to the black plastic ones).  My husband hates it because the recycle bin is small. (Well, now he has to empty more often.) I guess it might be better if both the recycle bin was of equal size to the trash bin - but I guess I'll have to wait for that to be available. Works fine for now. "
Sue B,4 years ago,4,"Overall, a quality stainless trash can at a good price.  I like the 2 separate bins for trash and recycle, and I don't have to make multiple trips to the garage to the larger recycling bin.  The bag holder works pretty well holding the bag in place (I only use bags on the trash side).  I wish a deodorizer would have been included so I would know if its worth it to buy. "
rachier,2 years ago,2,"The can is nice enough, but it honestly is too tiny for our family of four. What I really need is a single can the same size of this entire unit for just trash and another for just recycling. The concept is great, but it's more annoying than anything because we're constantly having to empty it. I regret buying this and will probably return and go a different route. "
Cbuscustomer,2 years ago,1,"This trash can was great!  Loved the soft close and ability to store garbage and recycling.  About a month ago the soft close came off it’s track and was easily fixed. After happening every few days and having to fix, today a metal piece broke yielding soft close useless.  For $100 I would not recommend a purchase and would look elsewhere. VERY disappointed. "
mwilly,3 years ago,5,"Ordered first one online at a discount but it was delivered with a broken interior piece.  Returned to Costco and ordered a new one.  However, the discount price was no longer available.  Costco honored the original price and credited my account the discount.  Perfect setup for our house where we actually use the larger bin for recycling and the smaller for trash "
Mary,2 years ago,3,"We liked the product for the first year, although as others have mentioned seating the bins can be a bit tricky in order for the lid to close fully. About 1.5 yrs in the plastic part of the hinge broke, and the manufacturer (EKO) wanted to charge me shipping for new parts under their ""5 year warranty.""  We will not be buying another product from that company. "
Eferz,4 years ago,2,The bins are quite skinny and fill up very fast. I would only recommend this can for a small household that doesn’t have high waste output. We fill up the recycling portion very quickly and have to empty the cans very often. Normal trash bags Only end up being used about halfway so you end up taking the bag out and using it outside of the Ken until it’s full 
Julie,3 years ago,2,"We were happy with the overall size of the receptacle for the two of us. We didn’t like that it scooted slightly every time you opened it so it eventually ended up against the wall. The lid never opened all the way and you had to keep your foot on the pedal to keep it open. It apparently came damaged because when I picked it up to move it for mopping under, the bottom collar/feet came off in pieces. Returned after less than two weeks using it. "
Venkey,3 years ago,4,"Ideal for a small family, the bins are little smaller than I thought but I like how compact it is in our kitchen. They are easy to clean and the stainless steel look is great. I observed that the two containers are so close and snug to each other that it is difficult to take one out without removing the other one. It is also difficult to find a perfect liner to match them the 8 gallon ones are too small and 13 gallon bags are just too big. "
Maria,3 years ago,3,Pros: Great to have the separate bins for trash and recyclables. Reasonable price. Looks great in kitchen with stainless finish.Cons: Loud “bang” each time the lid shuts and my putting felt pads on outer lid lip doesn’t minimize that loud “bang” - loud enough to wake the baby napping in our open concept living/kitchen. Body easily dented (came with small body dent in shipping but I needed it and didn’t have time to wait for replacement).

Traci Gay,4 years ago,4,"It’s sturdy & well made. But there are stupid design flawsOne is the impossible way of installing trash bags that allow the lid to close-does notTwo is there not a way to actually leave the cover fully o-em. The price was good compared to the $300 ones, but I, disappointed due to the above. "
chichicat,4 years ago,4,"I was using the battery powered auto lid cans, but they burned through batteries. The compartments in this can are too small for my household's daily use. The recycle compartment fills up so fast due to the small size. I do like the soft close lid and the overall build quality is very good. "
Shadowy,4 years ago,4,This price is great  but I wish the 2 compartments are equally the same size for regular garbage and recycle garbage.  We first used the recycle bin but it filled up very quickly due to bottle and cans are big..  Then we changed the recycle bin as the regular garbage bin then works better. 
Notfromhere,3 years ago,1,"This trashcan worked for almost a year. Then suddenly the ""spring"" mechanism broke - which is a tiny piece of plastic - making the entire trashcan basically useless. The lid now slams shut which quickly becomes unbearable. 5 stars for Costco customer service. This trashcan, not so much. "
Lisa,3 years ago,4,"It does what it says, looks good and works well. It helps organize and conceal my trash and recycling. The sizes of the bins don't work for larger items, but are generally fine. It can be difficult to reinsert the bins in just the right spot for the lid to fully close after emptying them. "
Miss Terre,3 years ago,5,"Love it.  I feel so classy.  I open it up and decide: trash or recycle.   Then plop.  It is done.  My 14 year old is in charge of empty and rebag so it is practically magic.   To remember the days of a paper bag in the kitchen, this product just feels like a reward for a life well-lived. "
RhondaCC,3 years ago,3,"Overall I really like the concept of this trash can but I wish it was bigger. The individual cans are too small and I can’t find trash bags for them. Also, because I am using oversized trash bags it can be hard to get the cans to align properly which causes the lid no to close properly. "
LPNT4E,4 years ago,5,"It contains both trash and recycle bins, so each bin is smaller, which I like them because of its convenience.  The smaller trash bin will require more frequent emptying, so it won’t smell.  The lid closing is gradual, not collapsing.  It looks great and functional exactly what I want. "
Michael,3 years ago,5,Me and my girlfriend are so glad we found this trash can. It is dual compartment and not too big for our smaller kitchen.The bins each have a nifty feature to ensure the bag is snug around the top rim. The soft close is great and it also has a soft open so you don't slam the lid open! 
Barb05,4 years ago,5,"I love having recycling and trash in one place. For my family of two this is a perfect size and fits nicely next to the patio door. Great price too! You do need to be careful how you put the two containers in or the lid won't close entirely but other than that, I have no complaints. "
ORD60601,3 years ago,5,"Minimize the pile of recyclables. Before this garbage can, there was the regular trash and then random piles of recycling sitting around. This makes it neat and easy to keep everything in it's place. The space for garbage is smaller but love the convenience of both in one can "
Lana,4 years ago,5,"I’m so happy this fit under my sink! It saves space in the kitchen, rolls out and in super smoothly, and is VERY easy to assemble. Since I’m in a rental, I used 3M double stick tape pads rather than drilling holes with the included screws and it still works beautifully well. "
Sonu,3 years ago,3,Its a decent trash bin and works well most of the time except when its used multiple time in a short span of time like in a party at home when its sensor gets operated multiple time. In this situation it stopped worked in auto mode and then you have to manually lift the lid. 
gules,4 years ago,5,"Love this, easy to use, ready to use straight out of the box. Use the side holes to hold the garbage bag in place.  It makes it so much easier to set it up.  Otherwise you will struggle to get a garbage bag to stay in place.  stable and sturdy.   Looks great in my kitchen. "
Anonymous,4 years ago,4,"Love the look and function of the trashcan.  Only complaint - as others have noted - is that there is not enough clearance between the two bins and the trashcan itself, so putting the bins back in with trashbags is a bit of a struggle every time. Wish there was more room. "
LROC,4 years ago,5,"As noted by another reviewer, the standard sized kitchen trash bags are way too big for this.  The individual sections are very small.  We are only 3 people, but it's too small.  Seemed to open and close just fine, nothing bad to say about it,  but just too small for us "
No name,3 years ago,3,"It's ok, seems a little expensive for a trash can. My main gripe is the odd size of the individual compartments. Normal 5 gal bags don't fit the smaller compartment; they aren't deep enough. Same problem with the larger compartment. Do they make extra tall/narrow  bags? "
Debbie,2 months ago,4,"Very nice trash and recycle bin.  The inserts are smaller than I'm used to and they fit snugly into the bin, which can make it tricky to get them back in.  Especially if you put a trash bag on them like I do.  Otherwise, it looks great and I am happy with the purchase. "
Anonymous,4 years ago,3,"Trash can looks great but the situation with the internal bins is ok. When placing bag liners, they tend to stick out of the lid and looks messy. It's also quite hard to just keep a bag in place if you don't have the exact size for the bin. Good concept, ok execution. "
Robb,3 years ago,5,This garbage can is an excellent purchase. It’s kept the recycling off my counters waiting to be taken out. The trashcan has liners inside that make it easy to change bags. It’s also heavy enough that my naughty dog can’t push it over to rummage through the contents. 
Richard,4 years ago,5,The back of the lid does not leave any scratches/marks on the back wall no matter how hard you push down on the lever. This was important to us because we have another bin (expensive) that swings opens too violently and has left many dark scratches on our white wall. 
Shan,2 years ago,2,"I love the concept of both garbage and recycling in one bin, but this one is tricky to empty. The bins are difficult to wiggle back into place. If it’s just slightly off, the lid won’t close. Ours arrived with a large dent in the stainless steel, so maybe that’s why? "
Jreview,3 years ago,4,"Overall it’s a nice bin. The two compartments in one compact unit really saves space. The unit received was a bit marred on the top edges, just not packed well enough to protect the finish. Mechanism squeaks a bit but that seems to be working itself out with use. "
DThea,3 years ago,5,"I love having trash and recycle in one can.  Lid closes slowly and there is a button to keep lid up so you don’t have to keep your foot on pedal.  Since I have more recycling than trash, I use the smaller container for trash. Bins look small, but the hold a lot. "
Anonymous,4 years ago,3,"The overall product is nice however the size is not what I expected... both compartments are smaller (much smaller) than I need them to be. This item maybe more suitable for a household size of two, though not one the size of five... we are emptying them daily. "
Mihaela,3 years ago,5,"Really happy with this sleep and stylish trash can. It is very convenient with two compartments in one. We are family if seven so recycling bin side I am using for recycling of cardboard, glass and such which we empty daily. The rubbish side lasts us a week. "
Jenn,3 years ago,4,Love that it’s a two in one trash can. Some reviewers complained about the size but it’s just two of us so we don’t mind having to take the trash out as often. Definitely a space saver for those who don’t want two trash cans. I would recommend this purchase. 
JustDaisy,5 years ago,4,"Love this trash can, and the flexibility it offers with the 2 different bin sizes.  My absolute only issue is that it slides around too much on the tile floor of the kitchen.  It would be nice if it was manufactured with a rubber bottom so it would stay put. "
Anonymous,4 years ago,4,It arrived without dent as it was double boxed. We have had it so 3 weeks now. So far so good. My only complaint is you have to line up the bins perfectly to drop them in. Sometimes it takes a few juggling. Overall we are happy with it. Good value for money. 
WisD,4 years ago,5,A hands free and dual bin receptacle. This was just what we needed for a kitchen trash container. We use the larger section for recycling and it’s been working out great. The rubber grommet with the grabbers help keep the bag in place and hidden from view. 
Mickz,3 years ago,4,"I’m only giving 4 stars because it has dent when it arrived. It’s hard to evenly put the containers(trash and recycle) back when I empty them. But the part I like is that,  All-in-One- Trash and recycle bins! Organized and have I more space in my kitchen. "
Bthecat,4 years ago,4,"It feels well built and sturdy, the internal cans have holes to hold trash bags since they are not the size of traditional trash bags, like having one spot for trash & recycling. Size of each can is understandably small so a family will be emptying often. "
Monica CB,5 years ago,4,Finally found a two in one on sale. Not big enough for a recycling conscious family but large enough for a couple. Needs something to keep it in place as it slides back each time I use it. But I like that I don't need an extra recycling can any longer 
Ecourt,3 years ago,4,The bins are a bit of a puzzle every time you put them back after emptying them and the product came with a small ding on the side that is probably only noticeable to me. All in all this is half the price of a simple human can so we are happy with it. 
Derek,4 years ago,5,"Very happy to find a nice looking garbage can with a separate compartment for recyclables in a relatively compact size. It's nice that it has a compartment for an air freshener, though I have not used it yet. Looks and functions exactly as described. "
Jean,4 years ago,5,I love the easy open pedal. 
Anonymous,4 years ago,3,"Though its a neat idea to have two bins in one the size of each is too small. We found ourselves changing the bag more often and the recycle bin was to small, I guess if you're just using it for cans its OK, But anything bigger will not work well. "
Dino,3 years ago,4,"Works very well for me but I am the only one in the house. I use the larger container for recycling smaller one for trash. need to remember to line up handles on containers, they should be facing on the outside left and right or lid won't close. "
Great White North,4 years ago,1,"Very small bins compared to the dual I have now, and it’s quite pricey for a trash can that will not hold much. Looks nice on the outside but would not be much use for a small family.  Step on cans are also known to break fairly quickly as well. "
Mimijia,11 months ago,4,For a family of 2 is very good and useful since it has a recycling bin. My husband likes it. It’s well made. The only short coming is the smudges free statement is not really true. But it’s minor as long as u don’t touch it with hands too much. 
Chris,4 years ago,5,I was looking for something that had dual bins in it for recycling purposes. Plus wanted something that looked really nice in my remodeled kitchen. This fit the bill perfectly. It also has the pedal on the bottom for easy opening. Love it! 
Fajita,4 years ago,4,"I am really enjoying this so far, was worried the trash compartment would be too small, but it’s great. Our last can had the battery operated lid and I ruined it by using water to clean it...I am happy to go back to the foot/pedal opener "
Mikey,4 years ago,5,I really like the trash can. It's sturdy and attractive. The only problem I have is that I cannot find plastic trash bags that will fit easily in the small trash container. The only ones that I can find are the same size as the big one. 
Kiwitooka1,4 years ago,5,It’s so convenient to have both in one. Once you fill up the recycling one ( I use the green) then take the bag out and continue to use it to collect more recyclables and then transfer to the big until full. It’s easier that way I find. 
Debbie,4 years ago,4,I like to put a trash bag liner and the bin placements are very tight so that requires a little work every time you empty it.  It is very good quality but In my opinion too small for a family. Perfect for a one or two person household. 
Anonymous,4 years ago,1,"Sorry, this waste can does not work well for us. The plastic bin inserts are difficult to put in and take out for emptying . I can't find garbage bags to fit the plastic bins and the overall size is just too small for our busy kitchen. "
Anonymous,4 years ago,5,I love the foot press to open and slow close. The dual can is awesome but I have noticed the trash fills up quicker being smaller. Not that big of a deal to us but may be a bother to some. All in all it does a great job and looks nice. 
Patty,3 years ago,3,Nice garbage but with the two containers they are pretty small.  I would love to know what people use for the air freshener because everything I’ve bought doesn’t fit.  Not sure if I would have bought it if I would have seen it first. 
Jp2010,4 years ago,1,"The reason for the one point is when received the lid was missing a part. So, the lid was loose. Checked box to see if was in there, it wasn't.  Returned it to local store, able to get a refund. Will reorder again, it's only on line. "
Ammy,3 years ago,2,The trash can is expensive for the fact that it is a manual trash can the compartment is two slim for recycle side. I regret paying the price for this product. The step could have been smooth. You have to press it real hard to open. 
Jacket Owner,3 years ago,3,The main reason for me on buying this item is dual compartment and that is good but the lid opening mechanism doesn't seem to be ideal compared to other company models and might break anytime. Let's see for how long it would hold. 
Gwilson,3 years ago,5,"I was a bit worried because of the negative comments, but I really like it!  It is very nice looking.  I use the large bin for recycling.  I like the holes in each bin where a bag can be pulled through to secure it.  Recommend it. "
Evelyn S,3 years ago,5,This is a very nice looking can.  It opens and closes easily and once you learn how to replace the two inner bins it closes correctly.  Love the recycle side of this as it seems to be the perfect size for our plastic bottles. 
C Evans,5 years ago,5,I have been looking for months for a dual compartment trash can and even bought one at a local store but ended up returning it because each compartment was too small. This one is working as I wanted without being over $135 
Emily,4 years ago,4,"I love the look of this trash can, which is ridiculous to say. It’s nice having trash and recycling together in one bin - however, we recycle a ton so it’s hard to share the space. So the best part is also the frustration. "
Elaine,4 years ago,1,"This is a nice looking combo trash and recycle bin, but the top broke off within a couple weeks.  We returned it and doubled the price and bought a Simple Human one that is worth the high price.  I would not buy this one. "
Justine,3 years ago,5,"Smell of trash contained, separate compartment perfect to separate organics and smelly trash. It would have been better if it comes with starter trash bags. I am now searching for the right size of bags to fit in the bin. "
Momo,4 years ago,4,I like the 2 in 1 for trash and recycle. No bag liner available to configuration of the recycle—messy w/o bag. It is skinny and long.I am thinking of switching sides of the bin. Always more for the recycle compartment. 
Jacob,4 years ago,4,We have had this garbage can for a few months now and it works great.  Have one container for trash one for recycling and it has a spot on the lid to hold fragrance packets so your garbage won't ever stink up the place. 
ElenaL,2 years ago,3,"The first of these lasted about a year before it stopped working, but I liked the concept, size, looks.  Ordered a new one that arrived so banged up it was not useable.  Returned it, and a replacement was not available. "
Jenn,8 months ago,3,"It looks big in the pictures, but the sizing for recycling and garbage is pretty narrow. If you are an avid recycler, and want to empty it every single day, this here ya go.  I’m making due with it, disappointed though. "
Paul boutique,a year ago,1,I’ve had two of these and had to repair the closing mechanisms multiple times each until it is no longer possible. Very cheap components. How this has 4 stars ?? No idea! And why is Costco still selling this trash : ) 
gati1,2 years ago,3,"Trash Bin was very nice, arrived with two dents and one small scratch. I decided to keep it anyway but getting the right plastic bags proved to be an issue. Nothing will fit nice and tight.Decided to return the bin. "
JeHa,4 years ago,4,"Overall looks really nice and seems sturdy, but lid does not open high enough with step to place items in bin without hitting knuckles.  And, I have yet to find the right size bags to use with these unique sized bins. "
Babsy01,3 years ago,5,Like the two compartments. I use one for garbage and one for recycles. Still have another container in my laundry room for cash return bottles and cans. Anything that saves time and makes life easier is a good thing! 
Faith,3 years ago,5,This was a gift to my son. It came in at the right time for them. Their 11 months baby boy can’t get to the can like he did the other ones they had. They especially liked that holds both garbage and recycle together. 
Petowner,4 years ago,3,We’re finding it just isn’t larger enough in either compartment with the divider in place. Would not recommend version with two bins. Otherwise it is a good product as it is attractive and the slow close works well. 
Sammy,3 years ago,4,"The product is good and would recommend to others.  Look and feels good, like the lid lock system.  I gave this product 4 stars because of the top plastic rim of the bins broke right after first garbage bag removal. "
SDiaz,4 years ago,5,"It’s great, I love it! I had to mess with it a bit to get used to inserting the cans back in for proper lid closure, it’s worth what I paid for. I get lots of compliments on my TRASH CAN! Definitely recommend!!!!!! "
PHXKevin,3 years ago,4,This is a really nice trash can. My main issue is how the 2 inner parts fit in. You have to basically giggle them to get them to lock into the right spot otherwise the lid wont close. Other then that its fantastic. 
Anonymous,4 years ago,2,"Be cognizant that the dual container concept is great in theory, but don’t handle standard size tall kitchen garbage bags. If you don’t use bags and don’t mind having to dump and clean every time.....than all good. "
Vkar,4 years ago,2,"The idea is great if you're not going to use trash bags. No room for the bags on the outside lips and still fit together without a huge struggle. I sent it back. It was a very nice trash can and concept, however! "
Picky Buyer,3 years ago,3,"I was excited to find this dual trash can. I felt the separate containers were smaller than i hoped for. I also thought it came with a deodorizer, but instesd just provides a compartment to insert a deodorizer. "
PhilB,3 years ago,2,"There is overlap of the bins.  That means, one or the other will always overlap making it difficult to manag a trashbag or remove the recycling bin.  Unfortunately have to return.  Needs a definite redesign. "
Leilanie,2 years ago,3,"The trash can is a good size, however the recycle part is too small. Mine also came in damaged with a ding on the side, but it was too much of a hassle to exchange it. So now ours has a dimple unfortunately. "
Anonymous,4 years ago,4,"A good one, but I feel like it is huge but fits left than my plastic smaller cheap bin. Also I am having troubles finding the right bags as the bins are tall and not wide. Maybe I just have to look better. "
Pinnacle2014,5 years ago,4,"It’s a good trash can., looks nice and functional. Only complaint is I’m not sure what sizes the bins are to know what size of bag to purchase. The bin didn’t come with any information. We like it overall. "
Dub14,3 years ago,1,"Wish I looked at other reviews before purchasing. Nice concept but the separate bins are too small and hard to arrange in order for the lid to close. Also, you cannot line the bins or the top won’t close. "
Freeda H,3 years ago,4,"It takes a bit to fit the bins back in to the container, after removing to empty. FYI: For a family of 4 or more, both bins fill up within 2-3 days. Works great with teaching children about recycling. "
Anonymous,4 years ago,1,It was delivered with a big dent and I can’t even exchange it because they are no longer in stock! I’ve tried calling to try to get some sort of refund or something but it’s impossible to talk to someone. 
sona,3 years ago,1,"In this garbage can the compartment is very small and gets filled very fast, as I have family of 5. very inconvenient. they should make this little bigger in width so has space for both recycle and trash. "
Victoria,3 years ago,5,This is an attractive trash can and recycle can in one.  It is well made and was perfect for the limited space in my kitchen.  I was impressed by how well it was packaged to protect it from being dented. 
Tran,3 years ago,1,"I just bought this trash can. Upon removing the trash can from its box, I noticed the lid never closed all the way. For $100, this trash can is not worth it, and look at other trash/recycle bins duos. "
Jumbo,4 years ago,4,Works well for 2 of us. Use small side for garbage & large side for recycle. Would give 5 stars if both sides were the size of the larger bin. A larger family might want 2 seperate bins of equal size. 
Tami59,2 years ago,5,Love this item. Like the idea of keeping trash and recycle separate. If you have a large family it would fill quickly I am sure but with two of us it is perfect size and takes up little room in house. 
EmilyJ,3 years ago,5,We have a small family of two and this is just  what I was looking for. Love that you can prop the lid open while you cook! I hope it holds up. The can fits a standard size tall kitchen garbage bag. 
Swez,3 years ago,5,We got this trash bin during Thanksgiving sale. Quality of the product is one of the best. I only have one problem that recycle bin part is too small to even fit a gallon milk can. Rest is all good. 
Suntigres,10 months ago,3,There is a compartment for a deodorizer but nothing was included and nothing to tell you what to buy. Is this a flaw or are we eliminating paper with directions on what you can use from new items. 
Nwalker,3 years ago,2,The green bucket is so small that it doesn't hold very much. If you plan to use it to only for table scraps then it maybe ok. I wanted to use the can for recycle and garbage which wasn't feasible. 
Rob L,3 years ago,3,"Not bad for the price. The construction isn't excellent, but it's pretty good. The bins are a little finicky to get back in place. The lid isn't super responsive without a solid push on the pedal. "
Jon K,4 years ago,5,"Great buy! Very happy with this purchase! The garbage side is smaller than a standard can and doesn’t hold as much, so it fills up fast. We have 13 gal bags and they don’t fill up the entire way. "
Karen,3 years ago,3,"It’s bigger than what I expected which is good, but not fingerprints proof as stated on advertising. I like the duality for both recycling and trash. Still a good product to buy whenever on sale "
Austin,a year ago,4,The build quality is great and it's as advertised. Only issue is sometimes the two plastic containers that make the whole trash can have trouble fitting together with trash bag liners installed. 
Austin TX,3 years ago,1,"The lid was very stiff to open with the foot petal. The bin has nothing to help keep the bag in place, so it slipped every when taking the other bin out. Ended up giving away due to frustration. "
KatieMN,4 years ago,5,"Terrific product, very happy with this purchase. I use larger compartment for recycling and it works great. Comparable models I've seen in stores are at least twice the price. Thank you Costco! "
Jim C,3 years ago,3,"The trash can is well built and definitely is the right idea. Two cans in one, regular trash and recycling. Unfortunately the recycling side is small and we can't find bags that fit that size. "
Jaxy,3 years ago,4,Perfect size for my kitchen space. I kinda wished it was split down the middle as I do have lots of recycling but I think it is still great. Price is pretty good as I have seen more expensive. 
Anonymous,4 years ago,3,The garbage can looks nice however I would say my complaint is due to the size of the canisters.  really hard to get a regular kitchen garbage bag to fit in there.  Room inside is a bit tight. 
Anonymous,3 years ago,4,It looks nice and works well. We need to empty recycle bin more often since it is narrow but that's ok. A little tricky to get a trash can liner on the trash side bin. Overall a good product! 
Judy,3 years ago,5,Very nice and I love it.  I live alone so the 8 gallon trash and recycle area is just the right size.  I would not recommend for a large family but for a family of two/three it is perfect. 
Terena,3 years ago,3,I like the look and the quality is good but the bins for garbage and recyclables are small so plan on throwing out your trash more often and well before your plastic garbage bags are full 
Adcw,4 years ago,5,Slow closing lid and very quiet.  I was worried the trash compartment would be too small but it's actually very deep so both trash and recycling compartments are just right (family of 4). 
Ralph T,5 years ago,2,The Neocube is good for a single person but not large enough to handle all the recycle or trash for a family of two or more.  But it's cute and works well.  We love the self closing lid. 
San Diego,4 years ago,4,"It works but could use a few tweaks.   Recycle bin is a bit small and have to struggle to get the bins to align correctly.  Overalll, it's the best product I could find and looks great. "
Sara G,8 months ago,4,Love this trash! Only took off one star because sometimes need to fiddle with it to close properly if the recycle bin becomes dislodged. Otherwise perfect! High quality for the price. 
AVT3,4 years ago,3,Only because the recycling section fills up really fast and the garbage bags are difficult to find. But I do like that it fits in my home and it’s compact. So there is ups and downs. 
JL4284,3 years ago,4,Great idea to cut down on containers in your kitchen.  But had to return it when the 2 plastic containers were difficult to remove.   Lovedddddd the idea keep working on the design. 
Onohi,4 years ago,4,I like the style and compact size of the dual compartment trash and recycle bin. It was a perfect fit for my kitchen space. I wish it came in more colors other than stainless steel. 
Amo323,3 years ago,5,Perfect!! I searched for months and all dual trash cans of this quality were $200+  I use the larger side for recyclables.  I love the smudge free finish! Great quality and value!! 
Leah,3 years ago,4,"Due to the shape it’s difficult to use a trash bag.Also too small for a family of 4, unless you don’t mind taking out the trash every day. The lid works fine and it looks nice. "
Christina,3 years ago,1,In less than a week the 28 liter plastic bin cracked so I can’t use it. I’m going to have to return it. It’s also difficult to get the bags in without them sticking out of the lid. 
TracCP,3 years ago,3,"I like the idea of this but for us the actual garbage side is small and not convenient for a trash bag. If you have less garbage, more equally garbage/recycle, it would be great. "
Paula K,3 years ago,1,I ordered this trash can with 2 compartments one for trash one for recyclables. Received it without the compartments. I had to lug it back to Costco in the middle of the pandemic. 
Emily,3 years ago,3,Very nice looking but the 2 separate trash containers don't seem to have a good way to put trash bags in.  We decided not to keep the trashcan and care gifting it to someone else. 
Scott,3 years ago,4,"Sturdy, Stable. Wish there was trash bags made for this size. Either too big or too small. I would consider one compartment next time. Keeps smells secure.  I would buy it again. "
Pupmum,4 years ago,3,"It is a fantastic idea, but the intwrior bins were  just too small. With a family of 6 we would have been changing bags constantly. We swapped it for just the regular trash can. "
Looneyalice,3 years ago,5,"We love the ability to have recyclables and trash in one can. This is a very nice can and added plus, the lid doesn’t just slam shut. It closes nice and slow. No loud clunking. "
Dave,5 years ago,3,"Good quality, but VERY SMALL. This is overall the same size as a regular trash can except with a too small recycling receptacle. The trash receptacle is also cut by one third. "
Holly,4 years ago,5,I don’t have to have my recyclables next to my trash can on the floor taking up space anymore.Easy to take out and dump into our recycle bin outside!Love my new trash can!! 
Anonymous,4 years ago,4,Foot pedal opens and closes easily and quietly. Convenient way to separate out recyclables without having an extra bin taking up space. Slightly less room for regular trash. 
Cami,4 years ago,4,good looking. The recycling portion is a big small and skinny so we still put a lot of our recycling next to the trashcan cause it won't fit. Good for a 2 person household. 
disappointed,4 years ago,3,It is hard to get both cans in just right so the lid closes all the way - especially with a trash bag in one side. If you had a bag in each side it would be very difficult. 
K Knight,5 months ago,1,"Trash can had a small dent upon opening packaging, super small and recycle container needs a bag but there aren’t beads that fit its size. Very pricy for these downsides. "
JBell,3 years ago,5,"Really well made trash and recycling bin for the kitchen. The materials are solid, and it has a handy latch switch that keeps the lid up when emptying or changing liners. "
Anonymous,4 years ago,3,"Nice can in concept but unable to use a liner well as the fit is too tight. Also when empty, it does not have enough weight to not slide on the floor or try to tip over. "
Katie,4 years ago,5,We love of our recycle/trash combo bin! We live in an apartment where space is at a premium and find this size is big enough while still having a pretty small footprint. 
Deborah,4 years ago,5,"It’s perfect for the person who wants to recycle, which is very important to me. You can choose to compost food waste  or regular recycling either works too.  I love it! "
Donna,4 years ago,3,"Looks nice. However the bins inside are small and do not hold much. Also, it dents very easily. Two dents in the 1st week and I don't have small children, dogs, etc..... "
Anna,3 years ago,5,Simple trash can but gets the job done. Sometimes the bag shows but we have figured out how to make it more discrete. No complaints. Great size for trash and recycling. 
WhiteShrug,4 years ago,5,Matches my stainless steel wastebasket!  Just have to empty more often than the two regular wastebaskets we had before which took up so much space. I love this option! 
PP23,7 months ago,4,does the trick; and has two separate bins you can pull out which is convenient.  Only issue is the very strong chemical smell that is lingering after a couple of weeks 
Ryan,5 years ago,3,"The trash can is on the smaller side, pedal is hard to push down, and it can be a pain to put bag around the can and put it back in. Other than that I guess it’s okay "
E Taylor,3 years ago,4,I like the convinience of having both trash and recycling together.  My only complaint could be that recycle container is a bit small but overall pretty good so far. 
Dkimps,7 months ago,3,It’s the right idea I think just poorly executed.  I’d like the two compartments to be the same size and full size. So in essence making the entire bin a bit larger. 
Knittinsis,3 years ago,5,"It’s a perfect size for my one person household taking care of trash and recycling needs in one tidy container. It may be a bit pricey, but it takes care of the job. "
Packerbacker,3 years ago,4,It’s convenient to have both in the same bin but you end up emptying a lot because it’s smaller than what we had. There are 3 of us our family.      It is well made 
Anonymous,4 years ago,1,2 compartments are very small and also the trash bag frequently slips and cause the spill over to the can which i need to clean it every time i remove the trash bag 
Asdf1234costcofam,3 years ago,5,"Great quality, great size. EXACTLY what I wanted for my kitchen and by far the best price I could find. The soft close is a really nice feature too. Thanks Costco! "
Usman,3 years ago,5,It’s well made and got enough space. Good quality product. We need to Make sure the bins are properly aligned after changing the bag otherwise the lid stays open. 
Kpotts,4 years ago,5,I was skeptical at first about the size of the can inside this unit but they are perfect sizes and so easy to use. Very happy with finish and quality of product. 
Female,2 years ago,4,Containers are small (13 gallons or smaller) but its nice to have them both in one. Other Con - loud wacking sound when opening...and slight dent from shipping. 
Stuznet,3 years ago,5,"solid build trashcan. Nothing fancy about this trashcan, it closed tightly without emitting odor plus bonus compartment for freshener unlike automatic trashcan. "
No Name,3 years ago,5,Absolutely love it. Large capacity both sections holds a weeks worth of household refuse and recycles ♻️.   Soft close with option to stay open is great option. 
Anonymous,4 years ago,5,We use the larger side for the recyclables and use tall trash bags inside each.  Works well no longer have two trash cans in the kitchen and it looks good too. 
Wilsonrj,3 years ago,4,"Nice product, study construction.  The rubber feet on the bottom could be a little more extended, as it tends to move backward when depressing the foot pedal. "
Meaghan,3 years ago,4,Annoying to put bins back in. Once you get the hang of it is nice and convenient to have both together. But is annoying still. Perfect size for what I needed. 
lajones,4 years ago,4,This arrived today and I was very surprised there were no bags included nor at least one deodorizer filter. No online presence either. Anyone have any ideas? 
Lynn R,4 years ago,5,Love this trash can! It holds both our trash and recycling. Its out of sight anded I a beautiful can. It holds a lot more than it appears. Uses a 13 gal bag.

IGubler,3 years ago,2,We bought this in June of 2020 and loved it until December of 2020 when the mechanism that makes the lid  soft closing failed and now the thing slams shut. 
Casey,3 years ago,4,Looks nice. A little awkward to manage the two bins. Still trying to figure out the best bag size to use for this size/shape so that they don't stick out. 
Steve V,10 months ago,5,This is a great kitchen trash and recycling can. The recycling side is a good size. It opens and closes easily. It's made of God quality stainless steel. 
LA in CA,3 years ago,5,Exactly as advertised. Lid closes automatically and softly.  Nice to be able to sort plastics and  cans inside the house and not at the recycling center. 
Cecile Bois,6 months ago,1,"Very deceptive, should have sent it back, top full of bumps, have to place it where light won’t reflect all the bumps. Poor quality, not worth the price. "
Roma,3 years ago,4,It's sturdy and stainless steel. The only challenge us getting the bags that fit into each of the compartments. But I like having both buns in 1 vessel. 
Duffer,3 years ago,2,"The compartments are too small. They don't hold much and are awkwardly sized so bags don't fit well, they fill up fast and are difficult to get in\out. "
Woodrose,4 years ago,4,"The idea is terrific, although it would have been much better with two 28 litter compartments. I find the 18 litter side extremely small for my needs. "
Salv,3 years ago,5,This is exactly what we needed. It works great! I love these recycle bin & trash bin being all in one. Super easy to empty and super sleek to the eye. 
GRR1,2 years ago,5,"It is exactly what I was looking for.The only reengineering I would do is to make both containers equal size, but I’m completely satisfied with it. "
Anonymous,4 years ago,5,"Sturdy and attractive. Bins are snug, so tucking in garbage bags takes practice, but there is a feature for pulling the bags tight, so it works well. "
Kiku,4 years ago,5,"Very modern, clean design. Stable when stepping on foot pedal which has just the right size. Easy to use inserts and easy to keep clean. We like it! "
Lizzie,4 years ago,5,This bin is just right. We have more recycle than trash so we use the green bin for trash and black bin for recycling. It's wonderful for our needs. 
pamelam,10 months ago,4,Just opened it and it had a bump in it. Tried to pop it out but it didn’t completely pop out.  I n it now so I’ll live with it. Otherwise looks good 
Yehuda,3 years ago,5,This combo trash can is excellent! Holds just the right amount and allows me to keep the recycling contained instead of having it all out and open.

Casinofembot,3 years ago,1,"I thought this would be the greatest solution to the trash/recycling needs in my home. It looks nice when you remove it from the box. Once you have to put trash bags in it, it's just a sloppy mess and I've tried every possible different method. I think one of the issues is that the internal bins are shaped to be a puzzle inside the can itself so you really have to pay attention to which side goes in first,making certain that the bag does not slip down (because obviously NO bags are made this size) and you have to make sure the bins go in just right with the liner tucked in because otherwise the lid will not close completely. I do not have a much of an issue with the garbage side filling up too fast but once there are about 4 recycling items (2water bottles-2 soda cans) the lid won't close due to the slack of using a bag that will go deep enough and the bin being so narrow. *When* I take the time to place the liners in the bins and insert them properly, it looks nice until it won't close properly because there are a few recycling items in it.  If you live alone and have the time to mess with this or you aren't a neat freak, have at it but who are you kidding? you're looking at a trash can that's going to resemble your appliances. This can is not worth the price or frustration and I will likely go ""Office Space"" on it because I hate returning something I've used. "
thegrandparents,6 years ago,5,"Our hound has had to have his glands expressed for years. The buildup is very painful for him and he obsesses over it; the smell is bad; and of course the act of someone expressing them for him is quite unpleasant for everyone. Our vet recommended that we try a healthy weight food to bulk up the stool and coax the glands to self-express. We had good luck with other Kirkland dog foods (especially Nature's Domain), so we tried this. It sure worked! He's a happy, healthy dog now, and has trimmed down to an appropriate weight. Recommend that anyone dealing with a similar problem try this -- of course, your mileage may vary. Every food is not for every pup. "
KimmieJo,6 years ago,5,"We have been buying this bag for a couple years now and our chocolate lab loves it.  However 2 bags ago the food has a lot of powder in it as though someone had maybe dropped the bag so we were not to concerned. Then our last bag was the same way, seems odd that between the time period that we bought the food that the same thing is wrong. Now this isn't just the powder you get at the bottom of the bag, this is food dust/powder throughout the entire bag.  If the next bag is like this, we will need to select a different food and that will make us unhappy as the quality and price of Kirkland we feel is a great product. "
MarkW,6 years ago,4,"We have been feeding our Labrador Retrievers this product for 3 years. We haven't followed the feeding instructions since there was no weight loss per these. We finally settled on 2 large scoops in the AM and one in the PM. They've lost about 25-30 lbs each and now are maintaining weight (still higher than where they ought to be by about 10%). We adopted the 2 labs (black and yellow) about 3 years ago from a Lab rescue group here in Southern California. The previous owner had let them free feed, and they put on too much weight. Sometimes they get bored with the product and won't eat it. This usually lasts no more than a day. We supplement their feed with a vitamin for bone stamina. "
ScubaSteve,7 years ago,5,"My vet of many years suggested that I try this food a few years ago as a less expensive alternative to the much higher priced food I was getting from the pet store. My Lab has more than his share of food allergies and sensitivities and used to get sick often and I won't even get started with his messy stools. The food he was on cost a small fortune and he didn't even like it. He has loved this food since the first time he tried it and he rarely gets sick anymore (seems to happen when my mother visits, just a coincidence, I'm sure). Now my chihuahua has decided that he should be eating big dog food too, so he gets a tablespoon or so a day and he loves it too. Best part.. no more messy stools! "
Damask,4 years ago,5,"It so happens that our 8-year old dog had her annual vet check-up today, and the vet was delighted with her condition, which he said was excellent in all respects.  I had switched to the Healthy Weight Formula from the Adult Formula Chicken because I was concerned that she was putting on a little weight.  The vet said she has lost 3 pounds since January (4  months), and that put her at an excellent weight for her breed, which is what I had hoped for.  It's possible the Adult Formula was a little too rich for her during the less active winter months. I am very happy with the Healthy Weight Formula.  Our dog had no problems transitioning from the Adult Formula over a few days. "
Heather A,4 years ago,5,We have 3 adult dogs that are ALL rescue with their own individual health issues. The one thing they have in common is aging and joint issues that naturally come with age. I had them on a Purina prescription dry dog food because i feel it's important to get glucosamine chondroiton in their diet. This food has that ingredient as well as probiotics at a fraction of the price! One warning: Be sure to slowly introduce this dogfood with previous food to slowly transition. All have healthy stool now and love this new food and i know i'm doing my best for our family. Thank you Costco for carrying this high quality dogfood at an EXCELLENT price! 
Scotty,4 years ago,5,"Started out using the Kirkland Adult food until our vet said our dogs were getting a bit heavy, so knowing Costco carried this food I switched.  Started gradually adding new to old until they were fully on this food.They love it and have had no digestive issues.But my issue is getting it.  Out of 3 clubs in my area, 1 never carried it, the one I was getting it at stopped, and the 3rd still does, but for how long?  At the club that stopped, I was told to put in a request to get it back, if they get enough people asking for it they may restock it.If the last club stops I'll just go back to the adult formula, I'm not going to pay the extra price for shipping when it should be available in the local clubs. "
Judywho,4 years ago,5,Our Golden lost More than 17 pounds eating this food.  The vet tried to convince us that the only food that would help him lose weight was their OVERPRICED food. They even said we were just wasting time by trying this food. The only thing that would have been reduced With their food was my wallet! They wanted $26 for 10 pounds of food and this food was SO effective on his weight loss journey that I will never stop praising this for saving his life! He was 109 pounds and after 9 months is down to a much slimmer 92 pounds.  My sister’s also used this food to help her Labrador lose weight. 
Happy,a year ago,1,"Our previous dog had to be increasingly coaxed to eat it, and eventually stopped eating it even when mixed with boiled chicken and chicken broth.  The new dog will  not eat it.  I tried a new brand, which the new dog ate eagerly.  Later he was scavenging, so I gave him a little more of the other brand, and he excitably scarfed it down.  Then I put a little of the Costco in his bowl as a test, and he sniffed it and ran out of the kitchen.  I have been using the new food as training treats.  He likes it that much.  It is a pricier dry food that is shipped straight from the producer.  It is a bargain at twice the price of Costco, since the dog will eat it. "
Shebabear,5 years ago,5,"I have had my 3 dogs on Kirkland Healthy Weight dog food for a few years. I have 1 lg dog, 1 medium dog & a 3 legged 68 lb dog. The lg dog needs to keep his weight down because lg dogs are prone to bone & joint problems especially when they get older.The 3 legged dog I need to get more weight off of her simply because she does only have 3 legs. And my 3rd dog is on this food simply because the other dogs have to eat less calories. I  tried switching to Kirklands regular dog food & 2 of my dogs started gaining weight so I put them back on the Healthy Weight Dog food. It's a good thing they all seem to enjoy these kibbies. "
pwa12,6 years ago,5,"When my goldendoodle developed diabetes I needed a special dog food. The Vet suggested their Science Diet as the best formula for diabetic dogs, but it was so expensive. I checked lots of other brands but none had the formula we needed. Then I found the Kirkland brand, read the label and it seemed perfect. I checked with my Vet and she told me the Kirkland brand was excellent. I've been using it for more than a year now. My dog likes it and I like the price! "
Valerie C,7 years ago,5,I started feeding this to both of my pit bulls last July   I have a dog who is a diabetic and I have to really watch the fat content of her food   This is one of the lowest in fat I've found yet!  Both dogs love it and I'm loving the difference in price.  I was paying a small fortune for Hills now that I've found a good food I hope it never changes. 
Rescue dogs,5 years ago,5,"My dogs are not overweight, but are always hungry! We switched to a pricier brand with higher protein, thinking this would satiate them longer. We were wrong.  We fed them the same quantity, 2 cups per day, and the dogs gained 3-5 pounds in a matter of 2 months.  We switch them back to the Kirkland healthy weight formula, and can give them more food, but still fewer calories than the higher protein formulas.  We are sold with the Kirkland healthy weight formula, the dogs love it, they are very healthy, and remain full longer, as we can feed them a bigger quantity. "
WhoRescuedWho,7 years ago,5,"Adopted an overweight, senior dog. Giving him this food he lost the extra weight and the supplements have helped his joints. He is doing better and off pain medicine. "
Ginger6,7 years ago,5,"We have been feeding our 9 year old collie this food for 8 years and she has never had an intestinal problem!  NEVER.  However, you can't feed as much as you like if your dog is inactive.  We had to cut her back to two cups per day! "
Zilla,6 years ago,5,Our Lab GSD mix eats this food with gusto!  I have to say that he is not a fussy eater. He has lost weight. His stools are healthy. His coat is smooth and glossy. It seems to me that he is not scratching as much. The price is right. 
Wheaties,6 years ago,5,"I bought this for our older & very overweight chocolate lab about 6 months ago. She has trimmed down, her coat is beautiful & shiny again, & her energy level is that of a much younger dog.  My wife adds a half tsp of turmeric & she no longer seems to have the arthritic problems she had before. Needless to say she is a very happy lab. "
KrisS,3 years ago,5,"My 130lb. Leonberger diagnosed with Pancreatitis is doing really well on this food. It's the 3rd food that I've tried in trying to find an alternative to extremely expensive Rx food. She lost weight to fast and was unhappy with all of the others but really likes this one and is maintaining her weight (where the point is you can regulate slow, healthy weight loss if that is the objective.) I am going to stick with this food for my giant breed dogs even those who don't need a low fat food, as it's so much better for the giants to stay fit. "
Babs,5 years ago,2,"After almost 7 years, we switched from the Costco nature's domain turkey dog food (red) to the Kirkland brand Healthy Weight food (gray).  We are just into our second bag of the healthy weight food; our dog has been shedding tons of hair and is down about 5 pounds.  About 4 days ago he quit eating the new food.  The vet asked if we had switched dog food.  So that gray bag of Healthy Weight dog food is going back to Costco,  we went back to the original food (red) and hope his hair loss stops. "
Busymom41,5 years ago,1,"I never take the time to write reviews, but I felt compelled to share our experience. Our dog is very much like a goat- he eat EVERYTHING, including non-food items. As such, he has gotten overweight. We decided to switch to Kirkland brand’s weight management dog food to save some money. Our dog truly seems to dislike the food. I kept thinking he would get used to it, but after nearly the whole bag he still doesn’t like. He actually sits in front of his bowl and whines. Eventually he will eat it, but reluctantly. I just switched to another brand and he is happily chowing down. "
doglover623,7 years ago,4,I have been in search of this Kirkland product for some time now. Costco- thank you for bringing it back! 
JESS,6 years ago,5,My dog used to clear the room when he farted with his old food. With The Kirkland healthy weight formula dog food we no longer have to worry about dying from affixation! 
Eve A,a year ago,5,"Our Husky/ German Shepherd mix LOVES to eat, but the majority of dog foods have a high kcal/cup. After all my research, this has one of the lowest kcal per cup which allows her to eat more without the extra weight gain. This specific dog food has never been recalled, however, the manufacturer Diamond Pet Foods has a recall history. I feel this food is safe for my dog. She goes to the vet twice a year for check-ups and has never shown signs of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). She has been eating this food for 3+ years.  Our Senior dog, who is incredibly picky, enjoys a bowl about once a week. "
Warchild,7 months ago,2,"I got this food because one of my dogs is a little on the fat side even though he gets a lot of exercise. Unfortunately, both of my dogs dislike this food and it is the only dog food we have ever bought that literally sits uneaten all day, with maybe 1/3 of the bowl still remaining the next morning. I have to say it even looks unappealing compared to the other foods we have fed them (including the other Costco varieties). I can see where the weight loss comes from...feed them food they don't like and they lose weight!  We will not buy this again and will likely go back to one of the regular adult dog varieties. "
Amanda,3 years ago,4,Dog food has been great so far for our overweight lab. She transitioned well. I was greatly surprised at the price difference from online to in-store. I know that online inflates for shipping but I paid $41.99 online and then 26.89 in the store. Had I known about it would be so much more I would have made a special trip out. 
carolinagirl51,6 years ago,5,"One of my dogs was overweight and could not tolerate most grains. Corn was the absolute worst. Once I started him on the Kirkland Healthy Weight formula, he trimmed down and had no more gastrointestinal upsets. My other dog is diabetic and the vet prescribed a high-fiber diet for him. The Healthy Weight formula has a higher fiber content than even the prescription dog foods and it helps to keep his blood sugar levels under control. I've never had any problems with them refusing to eat. They love it. "
cher,5 years ago,4,"I bought this for the two dogs I inherited from my mother, they are little dogs but are used to the bigger chunks. To be honest it's not their favorite but you have to keep in mind they have been fed junk food all their life. My cat loves it! It is a great deal for a great quality food, they are already more peppy and Their appearance has improved also no itching. I will buy it again. "
Caseythedog,7 years ago,5,We have almost gone through the whole bag and our dog is doing great. We measure out his food everyday. We will be getting another bag soon. 
Andeshel,6 years ago,4,"I have a bigger dog who is not picky about her food, she probably would eat anything I gave her. She is getting older, needs to watch her weight and also needs the glucosamine for her joints.  This food is great for that, I especially like that I can order online and have a 40 pound bag delivered to my home.  She’s not the only one in the family that’s getting older. "
edubb,5 years ago,5,"My 11 yr-old, 3-legged lab has been on this food for 10 years.  She can't afford to carry extra weight.  I mix it with Kirkland Adult Maintenance.  Stools are solid and consistent, Energy level good. "
Trilogy45,a day ago,4,"I bought it because you can’t beat the price of $31.99 for a 40lb bag. I can’t say how it tastes because my dog eats anything. Really bought it for the price. I use it with other air dried/freeze dried dog food. Don’t buy it online because I paid $49.00 for it and then went to the warehouse and saw it for $31.99. What a difference so I returned it, had to lug it to the store, and purchased a new bag at the cheaper price. "
Kari K,10 months ago,1,"I thought the reviews were crazy when they said their dogs were having accidents in the house… an extremely gradual switch to this food and within weeks my 11 year old that has never had an accident was having 1-2 a day in the house. I thought maybe he’s just old and losing his mind, so when the time came, I bought another bag… one week in and now it’s extremely soft accidents all over the house, which escalated to every two hours waking us up to go out and not keeping any meal in. So the amount we saved switching to Kirkland dog food, the vet now has and some! DONT CHANCE IT. "
Sad Dog,7 years ago,1,"I thought that the ""Weight Control"" formula would be good for my dog. However, I began to notice a large percentage of uneaten ""fine"" material in every bowl, especially towards the end of the bag. I called to complain and was told that ""sometimes the screening process machinery becomes plugged and the fines get through"". Based on what I have seen, Kirkland has never unplugged the screens! That means you're paying for off-spec material to the tune of 2-5 percent per bag that your dog might not even eat. Also, after giving it a year, all of a sudden our dog started to develop lipoma's! "
iagal,5 years ago,5,Our veterinarian recommended this food for my Lab.  She loves it and has maintained her weight since putting her on it.  I get many complements on her shiny coat and she seems very healthy & happy on this food.  I love ordering her food on line and have it delivered to my door at no extra cost or having to spend a minimum amount. 
AlanS,7 days ago,2,"My two Border Collies have eaten this food for the past 5 years. Until recently, they would eat without hesitation. Recently, they have started looking at me and not eating when I placed the food in their bowls. Our male dog will eat almost anything  but even he is turning up his nose at this food.I switched to Blue Buffalo dog food, and they are back to attacking their bowls when I feed them. Our older dog seems to have much more energy than when I was feeding the Kirkland food.It seems like there has been a change in the formula, or at least something is different "
Thiki,7 years ago,5,Helps my 3 fat labs maintain a healthy weight. 
YuibaGal,9 months ago,5,"My dogs have regularly eaten Kirkland dog food.  As one of them has become older & slower, we switched her to the Healthy Weight formula.  I haven't noticed any weight reduction yet, but she seems to like the food and has no noticeable allergy or stomach upset to it.  Kirkland is one of the few brands of dog food still sold in 40 pound bags.  Many brands at the pet store are considerably more expensive, especially when you calculate the actual cost per pound.  I usually have this shipped to the house since we don't have a nearby Costco Warehouse.  It costs a little more for the online order vs the warehouse price, but it is still more affordable then many other brands. "
Michelle,4 years ago,5,"I have a dog who is a picky eater and has diabetes. I tried the super expensive prescription diabetic dog foods, and my dog wouldn’t touch them. After doing lots of research about what makes a good food for a diabetic dog, I actually found that the weight management food was a good choice for my pup. It’s not as well balanced for a diabetic dog as an actual diabetic dog food, but it’s a great alternative and my dog actually eats it. Plus, it’s a great price! "

Zilla,6 years ago,5,Our Lab GSD mix eats this food with gusto!  I have to say that he is not a fussy eater. He has lost weight. His stools are healthy. His coat is smooth and glossy. It seems to me that he is not scratching as much. The price is right. 
Wheaties,6 years ago,5,"I bought this for our older & very overweight chocolate lab about 6 months ago. She has trimmed down, her coat is beautiful & shiny again, & her energy level is that of a much younger dog.  My wife adds a half tsp of turmeric & she no longer seems to have the arthritic problems she had before. Needless to say she is a very happy lab. "
KrisS,3 years ago,5,"My 130lb. Leonberger diagnosed with Pancreatitis is doing really well on this food. It's the 3rd food that I've tried in trying to find an alternative to extremely expensive Rx food. She lost weight to fast and was unhappy with all of the others but really likes this one and is maintaining her weight (where the point is you can regulate slow, healthy weight loss if that is the objective.) I am going to stick with this food for my giant breed dogs even those who don't need a low fat food, as it's so much better for the giants to stay fit. "
Babs,5 years ago,2,"After almost 7 years, we switched from the Costco nature's domain turkey dog food (red) to the Kirkland brand Healthy Weight food (gray).  We are just into our second bag of the healthy weight food; our dog has been shedding tons of hair and is down about 5 pounds.  About 4 days ago he quit eating the new food.  The vet asked if we had switched dog food.  So that gray bag of Healthy Weight dog food is going back to Costco,  we went back to the original food (red) and hope his hair loss stops. "
Busymom41,5 years ago,1,"I never take the time to write reviews, but I felt compelled to share our experience. Our dog is very much like a goat- he eat EVERYTHING, including non-food items. As such, he has gotten overweight. We decided to switch to Kirkland brand’s weight management dog food to save some money. Our dog truly seems to dislike the food. I kept thinking he would get used to it, but after nearly the whole bag he still doesn’t like. He actually sits in front of his bowl and whines. Eventually he will eat it, but reluctantly. I just switched to another brand and he is happily chowing down. "
doglover623,7 years ago,4,I have been in search of this Kirkland product for some time now. Costco- thank you for bringing it back! 
JESS,6 years ago,5,My dog used to clear the room when he farted with his old food. With The Kirkland healthy weight formula dog food we no longer have to worry about dying from affixation! 
Eve A,a year ago,5,"Our Husky/ German Shepherd mix LOVES to eat, but the majority of dog foods have a high kcal/cup. After all my research, this has one of the lowest kcal per cup which allows her to eat more without the extra weight gain. This specific dog food has never been recalled, however, the manufacturer Diamond Pet Foods has a recall history. I feel this food is safe for my dog. She goes to the vet twice a year for check-ups and has never shown signs of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). She has been eating this food for 3+ years.  Our Senior dog, who is incredibly picky, enjoys a bowl about once a week. "
Warchild,7 months ago,2,"I got this food because one of my dogs is a little on the fat side even though he gets a lot of exercise. Unfortunately, both of my dogs dislike this food and it is the only dog food we have ever bought that literally sits uneaten all day, with maybe 1/3 of the bowl still remaining the next morning. I have to say it even looks unappealing compared to the other foods we have fed them (including the other Costco varieties). I can see where the weight loss comes from...feed them food they don't like and they lose weight!  We will not buy this again and will likely go back to one of the regular adult dog varieties. "
Amanda,3 years ago,4,Dog food has been great so far for our overweight lab. She transitioned well. I was greatly surprised at the price difference from online to in-store. I know that online inflates for shipping but I paid $41.99 online and then 26.89 in the store. Had I known about it would be so much more I would have made a special trip out. 
carolinagirl51,6 years ago,5,"One of my dogs was overweight and could not tolerate most grains. Corn was the absolute worst. Once I started him on the Kirkland Healthy Weight formula, he trimmed down and had no more gastrointestinal upsets. My other dog is diabetic and the vet prescribed a high-fiber diet for him. The Healthy Weight formula has a higher fiber content than even the prescription dog foods and it helps to keep his blood sugar levels under control. I've never had any problems with them refusing to eat. They love it. "
cher,5 years ago,4,"I bought this for the two dogs I inherited from my mother, they are little dogs but are used to the bigger chunks. To be honest it's not their favorite but you have to keep in mind they have been fed junk food all their life. My cat loves it! It is a great deal for a great quality food, they are already more peppy and Their appearance has improved also no itching. I will buy it again. "
Caseythedog,7 years ago,5,We have almost gone through the whole bag and our dog is doing great. We measure out his food everyday. We will be getting another bag soon. 
Andeshel,6 years ago,4,"I have a bigger dog who is not picky about her food, she probably would eat anything I gave her. She is getting older, needs to watch her weight and also needs the glucosamine for her joints.  This food is great for that, I especially like that I can order online and have a 40 pound bag delivered to my home.  She’s not the only one in the family that’s getting older. "
edubb,5 years ago,5,"My 11 yr-old, 3-legged lab has been on this food for 10 years.  She can't afford to carry extra weight.  I mix it with Kirkland Adult Maintenance.  Stools are solid and consistent, Energy level good. "
Trilogy45,a day ago,4,"I bought it because you can’t beat the price of $31.99 for a 40lb bag. I can’t say how it tastes because my dog eats anything. Really bought it for the price. I use it with other air dried/freeze dried dog food. Don’t buy it online because I paid $49.00 for it and then went to the warehouse and saw it for $31.99. What a difference so I returned it, had to lug it to the store, and purchased a new bag at the cheaper price. "
Kari K,10 months ago,1,"I thought the reviews were crazy when they said their dogs were having accidents in the house… an extremely gradual switch to this food and within weeks my 11 year old that has never had an accident was having 1-2 a day in the house. I thought maybe he’s just old and losing his mind, so when the time came, I bought another bag… one week in and now it’s extremely soft accidents all over the house, which escalated to every two hours waking us up to go out and not keeping any meal in. So the amount we saved switching to Kirkland dog food, the vet now has and some! DONT CHANCE IT. "
Sad Dog,7 years ago,1,"I thought that the ""Weight Control"" formula would be good for my dog. However, I began to notice a large percentage of uneaten ""fine"" material in every bowl, especially towards the end of the bag. I called to complain and was told that ""sometimes the screening process machinery becomes plugged and the fines get through"". Based on what I have seen, Kirkland has never unplugged the screens! That means you're paying for off-spec material to the tune of 2-5 percent per bag that your dog might not even eat. Also, after giving it a year, all of a sudden our dog started to develop lipoma's! "
iagal,5 years ago,5,Our veterinarian recommended this food for my Lab.  She loves it and has maintained her weight since putting her on it.  I get many complements on her shiny coat and she seems very healthy & happy on this food.  I love ordering her food on line and have it delivered to my door at no extra cost or having to spend a minimum amount. 
AlanS,7 days ago,2,"My two Border Collies have eaten this food for the past 5 years. Until recently, they would eat without hesitation. Recently, they have started looking at me and not eating when I placed the food in their bowls. Our male dog will eat almost anything  but even he is turning up his nose at this food.I switched to Blue Buffalo dog food, and they are back to attacking their bowls when I feed them. Our older dog seems to have much more energy than when I was feeding the Kirkland food.It seems like there has been a change in the formula, or at least something is different "
Thiki,7 years ago,5,Helps my 3 fat labs maintain a healthy weight. 
YuibaGal,9 months ago,5,"My dogs have regularly eaten Kirkland dog food.  As one of them has become older & slower, we switched her to the Healthy Weight formula.  I haven't noticed any weight reduction yet, but she seems to like the food and has no noticeable allergy or stomach upset to it.  Kirkland is one of the few brands of dog food still sold in 40 pound bags.  Many brands at the pet store are considerably more expensive, especially when you calculate the actual cost per pound.  I usually have this shipped to the house since we don't have a nearby Costco Warehouse.  It costs a little more for the online order vs the warehouse price, but it is still more affordable then many other brands. "
Michelle,4 years ago,5,"I have a dog who is a picky eater and has diabetes. I tried the super expensive prescription diabetic dog foods, and my dog wouldn’t touch them. After doing lots of research about what makes a good food for a diabetic dog, I actually found that the weight management food was a good choice for my pup. It’s not as well balanced for a diabetic dog as an actual diabetic dog food, but it’s a great alternative and my dog actually eats it. Plus, it’s a great price! "
Bob1,5 years ago,5,We just bought a second bag I love this dog food and her dog seem to really like it they're not eating as much and they're not using the outdoors as much if you know what I mean seems to be very good we have a dog that has pancreatitis and so the fat levels are perfect for her 
DesertDweller,2 years ago,5,"I adopted my female Chocolate Lab in January, 2022.  At that time, she was on a specialty diet -- she had a ""sensitive stomach"".  As my prior Labs had fed well on the Kirkland brand, I started her on the Healthy Weight formula.  She has done well -- no stomach upsets, and a reliable and predictable elimination schedule has resulted.  One major drawback: my local store did not have this, or any other, Kirkland Dog Food in stock during my September, 2022 visit.  Most dog owners know that you can't just switch from one food to the next absent a measured transition period.  A few days later, I found this ""flavor"" online, but at a significantly higher cost, thus averting a transition to a comparable (but more expensive) alternative.  I hope that Costco can continue to provide the Kirkland dog food line available at it local outlets. "
Bookemin1103,a year ago,4,"This is great dog food for our Senior dog, Fresno, the thing I find disturbing is just how much ""dust"" is in each bag.  I would guess about 5% of the weight of each bag winds up being loose in the bottom of the bag from the nuggets breaking into their smallest form. "
Anonymous,3 years ago,5,Our dog likes the food. Helps with keeping a Lab at the right weight. Also stops rear sphincter  problems that had existed with other foods. We are located in Western North Carolina and had the food shipped to us.  Arrived quickly and in perfect shape. 
Nadine,4 years ago,5,My sons dog is a 5 year old pit/boxer mix.  He was getting sluggish and over weight on the cheap dog food I was buying.  His coat didn't look good either.  Since he has been eating this dog food which we feed him twice a day he is looking so good and more energetic and has lost weight.  He actually likes the dog food.  All these positive results in less then a month! I will be ordering more.  It's delivered to my house!  A very happy customer. 
Joan,4 years ago,5,"This dog food has been recommended to us by two vets - and our dogs find the food ""more than tasty"" (haven't tried it myself). They (one white Golden & one mid-sized ""heinz 57"") never have a problem with the food - the problem is more mine if I feed them (give them a bit too much), rather than my husband, but we do feel that they have lost some weight. It's a very good product or else we wouldn't have been using it for the past 2-3 years. "

Arlo the Cat,2 months ago,5,Dogs free feed and have never gorged. Switched to this formula from Kirkland adult regular beef dry mix about 2 months ago. Neither are obese just getting older and putting on a few extra lbs especially after winter. Each of them have lost about 3 lbs so far. Gassiness has decreased...pleasant suprise. 
LinW,6 years ago,1,"I'm sure it is nutritious for my dog, but unfortunately she would not eat it.  Try a sample from a friend before buying.  Also, I purchased online and found it was $13 less expensive in the warehouse. "
Trinny2017,6 years ago,1,I switched my boy to this food two weeks ago and he hasn’t been able to hold the bathroom over night for the last week. This is not a joke. My dog is fully trained and competent. I have woken up every night to fecal accidents in my house because he just can’t hold it.... I returned the bag after 2 weeks of use today. 
Nikki,2 years ago,5,"We bought this originally because our vet said our dog needed to lose weight, he’s a German Sheppard. He did lose the weight but to our surprise he loves this dog food and it didn’t bother his stomach and you know how sensitive sheppards stomachs can be. It was a win win situation!! "
Marian,8 months ago,5,This food has all the nutrients we want in our dogs food but at considerably fewer calories than the National brand we’d been using. I was nervous about whether he’d like it but he loves it! He waits impatiently for each meal and finishes every bite. I’m thrilled with this product! 
Gabs75,4 months ago,1,"My dog has been on this food for years with no issues. As soon as I opened the new bag the smell was strong. It didn't smell rancid but my first thought was I probably shouldn't feed this to her. After reviewing the ingredients I noticed they added some type of grass near top of the list. I decided to feed it to her anyways and within 2 days she started whining at night and was having issues with her stool. She also woke up middle of the night and was acting strangely. I stopped giving her the food at that point. Fortunately I had another brand of food to give her but she hadn't eaten it in a long time, so doing a hard switch while not the best decision was better than this food IMO. She still whined for a few days but has been better since. Maybe it was just a coincidence but my gut told me otherwise. I don't understand why they added grass, dogs don't need to eat it and they usually eat it when their stomach is upset which makes them vomit . Needless to say, I'll be returning this bag on my next trip. "
Hi_There,3 years ago,5,"Both my small rescue dogs like the Healthy Weight kibble. They seem to poo frequently on this diet. What's surprising is that my old 4 lb rescue, who only really has her back molars left, seems to enjoy it as well. I soften the kibble with water for her. Not sure if my 10 lb rescue lost weight, but she's certainly not gaining weight (she gains weight very easily). The bag did burst en route to my location. Hopefully this brand won't undergo any recalls due to some toxic poisons being discovered, sigh. "
Echo,3 years ago,5,This dog food is great for reducing weight. My German Shepherd is overweight and I started to feed her the healthy weight formula. She has been on it for about a month and has loss 3 lbs.  She likes it and eats every kibble. I do mix it with chicken broth. 
Debbie,4 years ago,5,"My Golden Retriever needed to lose weight per her vet a couple years ago. I have fed her Kirkland Healthy Weight twice a day, along with a can of green beans(to make her feel full) at night and she has slimmed down 15 lbs. Exercise is also in her routine. "
Casey,6 years ago,5,I bought this about 3 weeks ago as my boxer was putting on a little too much weight with her old dog food.    She LOVES this food and after a couple of weeks noticed a bit of a weight loss without even feeding her less than I used to. 
Alexrey2,6 years ago,5,"My large breed dogs have been eating this dog food for years. It’s great!  Unfortunately, it’s becoming harder to fine at the Costco stores and I’ve had to start ordering it online. I hope Costco continues to carry it in the stores. "

Torigirl,a year ago,1,Vet said my dog should be on low fat diet so put her on sr formula and it was ok. But they suggested below 10% fat so switched her to this one. She hates it and she loves her food. And gives her bad gas. Won’t be buying again!

Next time I will just go pick it up instead of having it shipped across the USA for more. "
Mike,4 years ago,5,"Our dog was putting on a few extra pounds, so we started him on this product. He seems to enjoy it and has lost those extra pounds he had put on. We have kept him on it for over a year, he hasn’t complained once! ;) "
aloosemoose,6 years ago,2,"I decided to try this product because my Golden was a couple of pounds overweight.  When I started feeding it to him, we had to start taking him out for urgent walks 3-5 times a day!  It's like feeding a laxative to your dog!  I'm not sure if this is the intention but I won't use it again... "
Poppajh,3 months ago,5,"My dogs loved the food and have taken to the change very well. No issues with switching from their previous food. Shipping (as always) takes longer than it should, but the product is very good. "
The C,2 years ago,5,Great product that we have been using for years for our three Great Danes! Only wish the price online matched the price in stores. There is a significant mark up when purchasing online. 
ed6713,4 months ago,5,Reading the ingredients closely this seems like a very good choice for our dog.Used to get Purina Pro Pride. The  Costco brand seems very similar. Transition between brands was easy. 
cabbie,3 years ago,4,My older dog does not seem too interested in the taste. I have to add veggies and pumpkin to actually get her to eat it. I wish I had gotten or was able to have gotten a smaller bag 
HF715,2 years ago,1,Not a fan - my dog wouldn’t eat it (and she’s a labradoodle - she eats everything) and I didn’t appreciate that it leaves a film on everything. It’s oily and unappetizing to my dog. 
ketnerb,2 years ago,5,We have an older dog and this food keeps him healthy and fit. Our younger dog loves this food as well. We have been using this for our dogs for about 1 1/2 yrs now. 
Middleagedbroad,2 years ago,5,"The dog loves this food!  And so does our vet, who says it's a quality product.  Fingers crossed on the weight loss as our old boy needs to lose about seven pounds. "
pattie,3 months ago,5,"My husband started feeding this dog food to our large overweight dog 2 months ago.  She has gone from 34"" around her waist to 30 1/2"" and is much more active. "
Rj1956,6 years ago,1,"Bought this food to mix in with a high quality, expensive food that my dogs love. They did seem to care for this food, leaving it in their bowls. Even worse, terrible case of diarrhea, even middle of the night! My dogs are 7 years old, have eaten several different dog foods without any intestinal reaction. I will be returning this bag and probably never buy Kirkland brand dog food again. "
Pam48,3 years ago,4,My dogs wouldn’t eat it for a couple days but now eat it without a problem.  I think my two overweight dogs are losing.  One was able to jump up on sofa. 
Sidedeb,3 years ago,4,My dogs have lost weight since I started on the Kirkland’s Healthy Weight food. Even my picky little one eats it and he usually won’t eat dry dog food! 
Rami,2 years ago,5,Great quality for a great price. Our dog loves it. And ordering it online with free shipping makes us appreciate Costco and this dog food even more. 
c cleckner,3 years ago,4,The product is good.  I ordered via online and the dog food cost was $13. more that if i went in the store.  Will not order online ever again. 
daywalker12L,2 years ago,5,"Our dog eats this for breakfast and lunch and absolutely loves it. Plus, our dog stays in a healthy weight range annually at his physical exams! "
Henry,2 years ago,1,"My dog won't eat this dog food.  Was really excited I found this dog food for a senior dog but it the dog won't eat, it is a waste of money! "
Dog lover,3 months ago,5,"It is one of the best values at Costco, my Basset hounds love it and it has replaced the Vet prescribed food with the same nutritional make up at less than a third of the price. My issue is that my local Costco runs out from time to time, and I have had to order online at a $20 PREMIUM. Maintaining stock on dog food is far more important than any items for humans... ask any dog owner. "
Emmett,8 months ago,5,"Both older dogs transitioned well to this food, no issues and appear to enjoy .We like ingredients,  cost and feel its a good value "
weedshasta,a year ago,5,14 year old mixed breed = loves it.  I try to keep her from gaining too much weight as she is not as active as she used to be. 
Hollib1,4 years ago,4,"My dog definitely prefers the regular variety, but giving her this for two months a year helps her maintain a healthy weight. "
jarvet,a year ago,5,"My pup loves this food, he has diet restrictions and has to be on low fat food. He gets so excited when we bring in the bag. "
Lori,8 months ago,5,So far my dog loves this food eats it up so fast with no allergies or digestion problems. Another great product from Costco! 
Sophie,2 years ago,5,The nuggets are small enough for a 25 lb dog. Wish they came in a smaller quantity bags. My fussy dog loves this dog food. 
Dog lover,2 years ago,5,It should have been a 5 star rating. Great dog food.   It was recommended by my vet !!  High in fiber great for my dogs!! 
Mandy S,2 years ago,5,"My Rizzie girl loves this food and so do I - the price is great, a trusted brand, and keeping her weight under control! "
Nathan D,4 years ago,5,"Both of our dogs love this food.  One is older, who we bought this for, and the other is small and only 4 years old.  This had dramatically helped our older Pit mix with her joints and weight maintenance.  She is acting like she was 2-3 years ago and able to be more active.  This dog food actually worked better than the elderly dog food that Kirkland sells.  This has the same amount of glucosamine and chondroitin as the other food, but has been more effective for our dog. "
Jean,2 years ago,5,My dogs love this food and they need to lose a few pounds. I just bought it so I’ll se if it helps with their weight 
Desi,3 years ago,5,My Cavalier King Charles spaniel is very happy with this dog food; he enthusiastically finishes every bite! 
Roxy,a year ago,5,"My dog, Breezy, is a picky eater & diabetic. She is doing great with this food, so glad we switched to it. "
Viest,2 years ago,5,Have been feeding to my dogs for many years because they have allergies and can't eat many other foods 
Lyle,3 years ago,5,Our dog seems to like it and she has lost some weight. She looks healthy and her cost is shiny. 
Linda S,2 years ago,5,"My lab needs to lose 10 pounds and this kibble is low cal, thanks Costco for not overcharging. "
Shannon H,2 years ago,5,Product is gentle in stomach and helps with the much needed joint support for my Aussie!!! 
Sharon,5 years ago,5,Didn't realize it was much more expensive to have it shipped than pick up at the store. 
kathy0611,3 years ago,5,Dogs love it and hopefully will be losing a bit of weight soon. Will be buying again. 
Janp,9 months ago,1,Dogs constantly shedding and eye discharge. Switched to lamb formula and 100% better 
Ggcar,3 months ago,5,This dog food has helped my Labrador lose weight and maintain a healthy weight. 
Jamie,6 years ago,4,I bought this so our dog could lose a few pounds.  They both seem to love it. 
Marie,a year ago,4,"Dog likes it , not sure if she is getting lighter but not getting heavier ! "
jamiebro,6 years ago,5,And I love that it's lower calorie to help them maintain a healthy weight.

KarenD,3 months ago,5,My dog loves this food and has very normal bowel movements! 
Erin,3 years ago,5,My dog loves the food and seems to be responding well to it 
Yesenia,3 years ago,5,My adult dogs love it… my puppy tries sneaking some in too! 
Suzie58,3 years ago,3,We have bought two bags of this healthy weight dog food. Both bags had excessive amount of powdered dog food in the bottom. We sifted the powder out of the food and got about 4 to 5 cups of powder we threw in the trash. We are trying a different kirkland dog food next. We have the red bag. If the new bag is powdery we’ll switch dog food brands completely. 
Michaela,3 years ago,4,Great food to keep my dog at a healthy weight! 
Debbie,3 months ago,5,We switched to this food about a year and a half ago. Our nine year old lab needed to take off some weight but we did not want to just cut the amount we were feeding her. After researching the importance of the ingredients in several weight management dog foods we switched to this one. Our girl has lost between 15-20 lbs and is moving easier and has so much spunk and still eats the amount she is supposed to. Our veterinarian is pleased. We all are very happy. 
VLRo,3 years ago,5,Great Food my Golden Retrievers love it! 
ROCCO,4 years ago,5,"Excellent, healthy product "
Dogmama,4 years ago,1,"I think it's absolutely ridiculous that because I bought this online because I couldn't get into your crowded store, that you charged an additional $13.00 vs. the cost of the same item in the store.  Shame on you. "
Tillys Mom,3 years ago,5,"Great ""senior"" dog food! "
Cyber,6 years ago,2,"Unfortunately despite of the small size of the kibbles, none of my three dogs like it and they rather starve... I bought two large bags and I have had to mix one with other type of food for them to fool them and force them to eat it. "
Dozzer,2 years ago,3,"I’m not really sure how to rate something I don’t consume. I mean I asked my dogs but they just gave me a look, you know that one that says the bowls empty, why? I guess since they always eat the whole bowl full it must be good, but then they like their own turds also, so make of that what you will. "
susan57,4 years ago,1,"I never write negative reviews, but just have to this time. I bought this because it is so much less expensive than the brand the vet recommended. We have 3 dogs, and one of them diabetic, so low fat is important.   All 3 refuse to eat this. Even mixed with the name brand or topped with canned, they will pick it out this and leave it.  Oh, well. We tried to save.  Probably the first thing I ever bought at Costco that wasn’t up to expectations. "
Julie,4 years ago,1,My lab has been eating this brand for 10 years. Now she refuses.  Doesn't matter what i add to it. Thought maybe it was her age. Tried another brand of food. Non costco. And she is eating again.   Can't find any information on recipe or ingredient changes.  Feedback appreciated.  I have a 40lb supply going to waste. 
OakDen,7 years ago,2,"I have 6 dogs.  They all LOVE to eat.  3 of them only nibbled at this food,  1 of them REFUSED to eat it at all.  For 3 days she didn't eat until I bought another bag of our normal food. Will be returning the remainder of the bag back to the store for a refund. "
Gigi,4 years ago,5,"Very pleased w/2-day order from Costco! Larger jars were taped so they would not accidently open during shipping, 40lb of dog food was sealed in another tear proof sack. Everything was packed 2 help prevent possible breakage. Delivered in a timely manner (during covid19). Appreciate this service as we are at higher risk during this pandemic. We love Costco anyway, and this service is one example of Costco's great customer service! "
Lassie 49,5 years ago,4,"one of my dogs was overweight and she is a big eater, was at 80 pounds and the vet was telling me to get the weight off of her. I used this and added raw veggies and canned food and she lost 15 pounds over 5 months.Her coat is not as shiney so I ordered the Lamb variety and the 2 dogs are getting a mix of Lamb and the Diet food. Both dogs happy, more happy with Kirkland Lamb version mixed in. Delivery and lower cost appreciated. "
Krebsey,8 months ago,1,The last 5 or 6 bags of this food are full of powder. We are taking last bag back and will be switching to a different food. Something is wrong here. 
buckeye,a year ago,3,"Even though my dog finds this food tasty, it crumbles so easily that at least 20% of it is powder in the bottom of the bag.  Fortunately she will eat this too when mixed with water.  I’m not sure if it’s because of how it is handled when shipped to my home or how it is processed, but it is a problem.  One more thing, I haven’t seen any difference in her weight since switching to this food.  May go back to the senior formula. "
Nicole,4 years ago,1,"The bag was delivered ripped and I can’t use it. I called Costco and they were too busy to pick up, so I used the “call back” system-in which an hour later they called back, I picked up, and they then proceeded to put me on hold! I hung up after a bit, but I am not driving to a costco to return this during a pandemic and the whole point ordering online was to avoid that. I expect a full refund for this $35 bag on dog food. "
Ricky,3 years ago,1,"Dogs love the food , DONT buy online its double the cost with shipping. "
Cindy,2 months ago,5,"We love this food for our dogs and have used it for a year or so.  Our dogs have really trimmed down and are more active now.  The only problem is that our Costco store in College Station no longer carries this specific food.  It was OK ordering it online but I wonder if they are going to discontinue it altogether.  If you can get it, I highly recommend the Kirkland brand Healthy Weight Dog Formula food. "
Country Mom,4 years ago,5,"Our 6 yr. Border Collie/McNab girl was getting too heavy on another highly rated protein rich, high dollar dog food. Since we switched to Kirkland Healthy Weight Dog Formula, she is no longer a picky eater and is slimming down to her normal healthy weight for her frame. I'm loving that she has more energy and is back to her playful self. Big plus, I can have her kibble delivered and I'm saving money. "
Anonymous,6 years ago,4,"My in-laws' dog lost a lot of weight eating this so I bought it for one of my dogs. At first she was eating it, but now prefers to just skip breakfast and only eats at dinnertime. I suppose that's one way to lose weight, but she hasn't lost any weight in the months we've been giving it to her (and we have followed feeding instructions). So I give it four stars for working...for some dogs. "
april,5 years ago,5,"I was told by a customer that it was easier to order dogfood online, especially if you don't have the strength to lift the heavy bags. I went online to order and found that the dog food and kitty litter are ten dollars more.  If you are not paying attention and think you are getting a deal with shipping included, that's not the case.  Disappointed in how Costco prices items online. "
Monique,3 years ago,1,"Please listen to these other 1 star reviews.... I didn’t and now my dog has been sick for a week. Immediately after starting this food, my golden retriever has been having diarrhea every single day. She won’t even touch her food until the end of the day when she is really really hungry because even she knows it’s what’s making her sick. Do not recommend, keep this far away from your dog. "
mikej262,5 years ago,2,"Love the dog food, my dogs are healthy and love the taste.  Costco just changed the bag from a paper-based bag to what feels more plasticy.  It used to open easily at the corner and poured easily; now it rips along the seem and dumps dog food all over!  Costco’s reputation for high quality along with low prices is going down all the time!  I’d pay more, just don’t give me lousy quality! "
Chichi,6 years ago,4,"We have been buying this dog food for several years and in addition to hiking with our 9 yr old boxer mix, she is very healthy and muscular, not at all fat. This product seems to agree with her. "
EasyRider63,4 years ago,3,I’ve been buying this food for years. All my dogs love it but this last bag I bought had a sharp piece of wood in it. It looked like it came from a blue wooden pallet. First time in the many many bags I’ve bought through the years. My dogs love the taste but now I check to make sure I don’t feed my dogs any foreign objects. Production Code9342 DL KSH1207 JLY 09:15 
Letta,6 years ago,5,"My dog was overweight,and my vet suggested a different 'lite' dry dog food.  However, my dogs hated it, and we ended up adding milk or wet dog food, which defeated the purpose.   I decided to try this after checking the nutritional and calorie content, and my dogs love it!  They will eat it totally dry and they are losing weight to get down to a healthy weight again. "
BigGeorge,4 years ago,5,Our Golden Retrievers are 18 months old now and we're still trying different styles of the Kirkland brand foods to see which they like best. At 85 pounds each and growing fast they obviously like everything! We're pretty sure though the 'red bag' is their current FAV. They really liked this mix of food but they hadn't tried the other bags yet...to be continued! 
AnnE,6 years ago,3,"My older Lab has become more and more picky. He eat this food sometimes but not often, so I have been trying several brands. "
Mike1,4 years ago,2,"Came in a box that we could hear that the bag must have come apart because it sounded like dog food everywhere, oh my! "
Lara,5 months ago,1,Unfortunately the bag was opened in transit and Costco told me to bring it in to the store for a refund.  A 40lb bag of kibble.  It was a mess.  Terrible customer service.  There was no way I was going to sweep it up and put into a trash bag like they asked me to do. 
Carrie,6 years ago,5,My pooch is diabetic and I had to get him on a low fat dog food. Other diabetic dog owners recommended it and I am happy they did. My sugar baby gobbles it up. I do have one complaint..Th bag got a big rip in it sometime before we received it. It makes it hard tying to keep food together (spilling out) and not sure how much was lost due to the tear. 
UteGal,a year ago,5,"Reasonably priced dry dog food that my pets enjoy, this food is at least MADE IN THE UNITED STATES (albeit in some states that do not protect my rights.) Includes glucosamine and omega 3 & 6 and is formulated for weight maintenance. Bag is #7 recyclable, and my delivery person and I appreciate that it's NOT in 50 lb bags that are harder to handle. "
Suzanne,5 years ago,5,"We've been using this food for about a year. My Labrador Retriever needed to lose some weight. She needed to lose about 10 lbs. We brought the nutrition information about this food to the vet, and within about 3 months, Emma lost the weight. Now she's on a maintenance plan with the same food and some Kirkland bones. It's perfect and she loves it! "
Jimbo,3 years ago,5,"My Labrador is 5 years old. For over a year I changed dog food numerous times due to diarrhea every day. I was told to go to Costco. I did, no more diarrhea until last month. I left my dog with my son for 2 weeks. He ran out of Costco food, and fed my dog his dog food. Diarrhea returned. He told me so I ordered Costco dog food and all is well. "
linda l,3 years ago,2,Our dog loves this food but this last bag has too much powder in it. I thought it was just the sediment at the bottom of the bag as I poured it in the food container. After two weeks it seemed to just get worse. I just sifted out 14 ounces of powder of the remaining food. We too will look for another dog food if our next bag is the same. 
Beaglemom,5 years ago,5,I began feeding this to my dog after being scolded for my beagles weight gain - she was a rescue and it was hard not to spoil her. She began losing weight very quickly and I am always asked what I feed her because she is so soft! I recommend this product to anyone who has a dog with weight issues.  Don’t forget exercise is essential! 
JM Woods,2 years ago,5,"This is a good quality dog food. My dogs love the taste and my dogs did not suffer any kind of gastric distress when changing brands. My dogs had been eating Blue for years but like everything else, Blue has become so expensive that I can no longer afford it. This dog food is much better priced and the quality is really good too. "
Susan Cook,5 months ago,5,"Our chocolate  lab was on Science Diet and then Royal Canin.  After the pandemic, both brands became so expensive so we gave this a try.  It seems a LOT like SD… I wonder if it is?  Our lab has done fine on it and we haven’t had any issues 4 months in.  We are fussy about her so this was a questionable switch but it’s been great! "
Dave,4 years ago,3,Just bought in store for less than $25. 
RunninSuz,6 years ago,5,Both my large breed dogs (9 yrs old) love this dog food and it has kept them at a lean weight. My Golden has a very sensitive GI tract and this food is well tolerated.

John,4 years ago,5,"Our collie, McGee, is a real chow hound.  We feed him Kirkland Signature Healthy Weight Formula in an attempt to keep his weight under control.  It seems to work although McGee is still on the heavy side for a collie but doesn't get the exercise he should, living with two seniors.  Plus the economical price helps. "
cleomom1,5 years ago,4,"My 108 pound Labador needs to lose  weight. Vet recommended a different dog food. I discovered Kirkland's. We are presently feeding him the first bag mixed with his previous food. he loves the Kirkland Healthy Weight. However, we will need time to see if it helps. Thank you Costco for providing this formula food. "
PLut,4 years ago,4,"The first thing that has really helped with regulating my dog’s poo and getting it to be a good consistency (these are very important things!!). The only problem is my dog won’t eat it by itself, even when the package is freshly opened. No big deal, we top it with a handful of ground beef and he gobbles it down. "
Dean,5 years ago,5,5 year old boxer loves it.  He has gained weight and we are hoping this helps him shed a few pounds. He was on prescription food because of digestion issues.  His stool was always loose.  Now his stool is easy to pick up.  Free shipping made this a no brainier.  Now I do not have to carry the 40 lb bag home 
Jack S,2 years ago,2,"I thought this might be a good replacement for the Solid Gold Fit and Fabulous food we had our dogs on previously. I was wrong. The food is very ""crumbly"", the dogs didn't like it and it left them with very frequent and loose stools. I've since switched back, the money saved is not worth it for this food. "
H SHANNA,a year ago,5,"We have tried several other brands (non Costco, Purina et al.) Only this one sat well with their digestive systems and is effective for its purpose. We have one large senior dog, one youger more active one, and a smaller mixed breed. They all seem to love it. Fantastic value for the price is added bonus. "
Dpitlik,6 years ago,5,We have been using this dog food for a little over a week now and our dogs love it!  You can’t beat the price of this quality dog food! 
Crimson Tide,5 years ago,5,"This is good chow.  If you research it, you will find it rates as high or higher than most of the so called ""premium"" foods.  I've been using this for years and have been very happy with the results for our dogs.  The only draw back is for the first few weeks, your dog will have gas...but that stops. "
roses67,10 months ago,5,"My dog had gained 22 pounds from a grain free diet, she needed to loose the weight and the Vet recommended Kirkland chicken and rice. She loves this food and it cost about half of what I was spending before.  She has not lost weight as yet, too soon, she has only been eating for a couple of weeks. "
James,4 years ago,1,"We will NEVER buy this product via shipping again. Great product, awful delivery. Whoever thought wrapping the bag in flimsy plastic bag material and shipping it with all sorts of boxes, etc. able to slice it up needs a new career. It arrived ripped and leaking kibble. Not COSTCO quality at all. "
KCINRC,2 years ago,5,"Our 12 year old Labrador loves this food! She’s already lost weight after just a couple of weeks! We were feeding her the Costco Salmon and Sweet Potato recipe for years, but she was slowing down and gaining weight so we switched her and it worked out great! Highly recommended for your older dog. "
Stephie66,3 years ago,1,This arrived and we found black beetles in our dogs bowl and food!  Grossed us all out and no wonder she wouldn't eat it.

We are presently feeding him the first bag mixed with his previous food. he loves the Kirkland Healthy Weight. However, we will need time to see if it helps. Thank you Costco for providing this formula food. "
PLut,4 years ago,4,"The first thing that has really helped with regulating my dog’s poo and getting it to be a good consistency (these are very important things!!). The only problem is my dog won’t eat it by itself, even when the package is freshly opened. No big deal, we top it with a handful of ground beef and he gobbles it down. "
Dean,5 years ago,5,5 year old boxer loves it.  He has gained weight and we are hoping this helps him shed a few pounds. He was on prescription food because of digestion issues.  His stool was always loose.  Now his stool is easy to pick up.  Free shipping made this a no brainier.  Now I do not have to carry the 40 lb bag home 
Jack S,2 years ago,2,"I thought this might be a good replacement for the Solid Gold Fit and Fabulous food we had our dogs on previously. I was wrong. The food is very ""crumbly"", the dogs didn't like it and it left them with very frequent and loose stools. I've since switched back, the money saved is not worth it for this food. "
H SHANNA,a year ago,5,"We have tried several other brands (non Costco, Purina et al.) Only this one sat well with their digestive systems and is effective for its purpose. We have one large senior dog, one youger more active one, and a smaller mixed breed. They all seem to love it. Fantastic value for the price is added bonus. "
Dpitlik,6 years ago,5,We have been using this dog food for a little over a week now and our dogs love it!  You can’t beat the price of this quality dog food! 
Crimson Tide,5 years ago,5,"This is good chow.  If you research it, you will find it rates as high or higher than most of the so called ""premium"" foods.  I've been using this for years and have been very happy with the results for our dogs.  The only draw back is for the first few weeks, your dog will have gas...but that stops. "
roses67,10 months ago,5,"My dog had gained 22 pounds from a grain free diet, she needed to loose the weight and the Vet recommended Kirkland chicken and rice. She loves this food and it cost about half of what I was spending before.  She has not lost weight as yet, too soon, she has only been eating for a couple of weeks. "
James,4 years ago,1,"We will NEVER buy this product via shipping again. Great product, awful delivery. Whoever thought wrapping the bag in flimsy plastic bag material and shipping it with all sorts of boxes, etc. able to slice it up needs a new career. It arrived ripped and leaking kibble. Not COSTCO quality at all. "
KCINRC,2 years ago,5,"Our 12 year old Labrador loves this food! She’s already lost weight after just a couple of weeks! We were feeding her the Costco Salmon and Sweet Potato recipe for years, but she was slowing down and gaining weight so we switched her and it worked out great! Highly recommended for your older dog. "
Stephie66,3 years ago,1,This arrived and we found black beetles in our dogs bowl and food!  Grossed us all out and no wonder she wouldn't eat it. 
Simon,3 months ago,4,"Mostly good, but deducted one star for excessive crumbs (dust) in the mixture. There is a significant amount of kibble dust in this mixture due to dry kibble which can be alleviated somewhat by adding water. Otherwise it was well tolerated by my dog. "
The Pride,6 years ago,5,"Bought this for our chubby Golden Retriever.  He loves it, can have a bit more than his previous more fattening food (Costco's also), his condition is still great.  Compares well to diet brands that are much more expensive when you check the labels. "
Tina,3 years ago,5,My dogs really like this food and it’s healthy for them! I actually decided to get this food because of a review someone posted about their dog losing weight. My girls have also been losing excess weight and it’s made a huge improvement in mobility. 
Carrie,4 years ago,5,I have a large Mastiff that needs high protein low fat food. I was buying the very expensive buffalo brand and needed to find something that would not put us on the street. My dog eats 8 cups of food per day. This is just what I needed. thank you. 
Jami,2 years ago,5,"My dog has a very finicky stomach until I started him on the Kirkland Healthy weight.  Not only is it very digestible for him, he's stayed at a healthy weight.  He is 12 years old and it has joint supplements in it as well as omega fatty acids. "
GammaS,3 years ago,4,"We switched from a high end brand to get away from so much flatulence. This is working better for our two golden retrievers, and of course is much less expensive. So far all is well. Good control of weight creep that comes in less active dogs. "
Pickrell,6 months ago,4,"It would be nice to show actual pictures of the kibble! We have smaller dogs and are constantly forgetting the actual variety name, but we know what the kibble looks like. Just would be nice to have a pic either on the website or on the bags "
F Johnson,4 years ago,5,Good quality weight control dog food at a great price per lb.  I add a small amount of this to our dog's prescription dry dog food to make it go farther for cost purposes.  Our dog loves the taste and gets a kibble piece for a treat as well. 
gran54,6 years ago,5,"I started my dog on this product over a year ago and have had good results in him getting to a better weight.  For the price, the product and the ease of having it delivered factor in for me keeping with this dog food.  Buddy enjoys it too, "
Momma5757,4 years ago,5,We’ve tried a couple different foods since our local Costco stopped carrying this. The price is higher online but still worth it. Our dogs (a Boston Terrier and a Yorkie) had horrible gas on everything else we tried. They do great on this! 
MetroMom,3 years ago,5,"Our dog loves his new food. And I love having the big, heavy bag delivered to my door. Costs a fraction of the weight management food prescribed by the vet. Not sure if related to food change, but my woof’s bowel moments are more regular. "
bjbla,4 years ago,4,"My dogs pretty much like all the dog food from Costco. This is first time for this one but just got it so not sure if they will like or not. I have a lab that eats evrything in sight, typicalFOR A LAB. Also, a golden mix who is finicky. "
Temera1,4 years ago,1,This dog food got my dog very sick. I am returning it because well he cant eat it anymore. He only had a small handful of the dog food. He got diarrhea really bad. It was like a water facet coming out. He was taken to the vet twice. 
Hannah,5 years ago,2,Switched my dog from Wellness Senior to this. My dogs coat looks AWFUL and he has hot spots all over his legs and belly. He’s now on medication and the vet stated it was from the quality of food. He will be weaned off the food ASAP. 
Hot Madre,4 years ago,5,"This is an excellent grade dog food and really affordable.  I have 2 Golden Retrievers & we work hard on keeping them at a healthy weight!  This food fills their bellies, their nutritional needs ALL while not filled w bi-products. "
Lyndi,2 years ago,4,"My dog has been on this food for quite a while now, at least 6 months and he has only lost 2 pounds, but two is better than nothing. He eats it fine, but I don’t think he loves it as he does not gobble it right up like he used to. "
Anonymous,4 years ago,1,"Product arrived open bag, resealed with packing tape and weighed only 18 pounds. I had to return to the local store for credit. And there I learned that the price is marked up almost DOUBLE on the website. Will never order again! "
Mapaly,2 months ago,5,"My only complaint was that the delivery of my product took 2 weeks to arrive. I don't know if Costco has difficulty manufacturing Kirlan Signature brand dog food, there is no stock in Locakes stores. I'll have to change dog food. "
minivanMom,a year ago,5,"We have bought the dog food a few times and our dogs loves it. Though the online delivery experience was not pleasant as we didn't actually received it, it never arrived so ended up still driving and buying one from the store. "
Jeff S,7 months ago,3,"It’s been about a month, and she still doesn’t seem to care for it. However, she eventually eats when she gets hungry enough. Her BM’s have doubled in size and number per day. Don’t know if it’s the weight loss formula or not. "
Fireweed,4 years ago,5,My dog has always had trouble keeping his weight down.  Our 130 lb dog dropped to 112 (ideal body weight based on body score conditioning) in about 6 months eating this dog food.  He has now maintained this weight for a year. 
Teri C,4 years ago,4,My dogs Love this food!  I wish my local store carried it so I don't have to get it shipped. This kibble breaks down a bit more than others from being bounced around during shipping. (4/5) overall excellent nutritional score. 
Robin,6 years ago,5,I have been buying this in store for over a year but the store is very far from my home now so I decided to order it.  This food is comparable to a lot of the high-end food's at pet stores and the price is significantly less. 
CBx3,a year ago,5,My dogs had stomach issues with all the really expensive dog foods that were suppose to be the best of the best but this dog food is the only one that they enjoy and have no issues and you can’t beat the price and quality . 
rubicon2,4 years ago,5,"I've been using Kirkland dog food since they were puppies, then migrated to adult food and then migrated again to healthy weight. All they eat is the dry food and they have great teeth and good weight, my vet is very happy. "
Liz7738,6 years ago,5,This is a great food. I was very happy when my neighbor turned me on to it. It has a good nutritional value. I could no longer afford the high price dog food and this one is just as good. My dog doesn't complain either. 
onehappycamper,a year ago,5,"My 3 dogs like this food. I have discovered that it is much cheaper when purchased in store as opposed to online.  Much cheaper than the Blue Buffalo I had been feeding them, but seems to have good nutrition for them. "
Linus,6 years ago,5,"I've used Kirkland dog food from Costco for many years.  I no longer live close to a Costco store, so being able to buy this high quality dog food on line at a reasonable price is really a service to me and my dogs. "
SP273,3 years ago,5,"Our dog loves it (although he is a little pudgy - more due to winter than the food I suspect). Oddly, our cat likes it, too - she will sneak in the kitchen after the dog eats and steal a piece that he left behind. "
Royce and Bean,2 years ago,5,"Best priced ""healthy weight"" dog food on the market, and all my canine roommates and guests love it. Stirring in a splash of water turns the dry kibble dust into ""gravy"" and seems to aid in the weight loss, too. "
JessicaC,5 years ago,5,My rescue dog is reaching a weight recommended by the vet very easily. She likes the taste. It seems to keep her full without too many calories.it was so easy to get it delivered in a couple days to the house. 
Happy mom,3 years ago,5,I have been feeding my dogs with Kirkland products for years. We have not experienced any food allergies or refusal to eat with any of their products. It always meets high standards when rated professionally. 
Teddy,6 years ago,5,My dog was given to my 6 months ago as a service dog. The person that gave me the dog was using this product and so it was easy to continue the routine.  He seems to be quite pleased with that I am doing so. 
Allen,3 years ago,5,"I tried switching to Kibbles and Bits. One of  my dogs, a small terrier, turned up his nose at it. He crawled into the empty bag of Kirkland, ate the remaining kibble and licked the bag *absolutely* clean. "
cattitude52,5 years ago,5,"Been feeding my two Labs this for years. Our Yellow Lab ""Abbie"" just passed last year at 15 years old. One of her babies, Zoey, just turned 13 in December. I'm sure both good genes and healthy food helped! "
KathyMcP,4 years ago,5,"Our dog loves the kibble, mixed with chicken. Vet MD said this is a good brand and composition for our 15-year old golden doodle. We trust the Kirkland Brand. We love that you ship so quickly to our door. "
Desiree,4 years ago,5,I love this product my boys do too! We used this when we switched them off a raw food diet and they transitioned so well! They have nervous stomachs and we had no issues when we finally found this brand! 
JonB,4 years ago,5,"My beagle was getting ‘tear drop stains’.  I tried all types of expensive dog foods, limited ingredients etc. nothing worked. I tried this Kirkland brand and they slowly disappeared and they’re now gone. "

DebH,4 years ago,5,"Our dog needs to lose a little weight, especially after knee surgery. We switched her over gradually and she is eating the Healthy Weight formula just fine. It is an easy way to cut her calorie intake. "
Shandlady,6 years ago,5,"My dog loves this food.  He is a cockapoo mix (standard poy size).  It was a gamble to jump into 40lbs of food but he likes all Kirkland products, so why not.  I am trying to reduce his caloric intake. "
crzylady55,6 years ago,4,"My dogs are eating this food so I guess it is satisfying them.  It to soon to know how it is going to effect the little pudge balls, but hoping it will help bring their weight down to a better place. "
Dave,4 years ago,5,My vet told me my dog was over weight and wanted me to buy $100.00 a bag dog food. I chose Kirkland brand for a lot less money and my dog weight is under control and still losing. Thank you Kirkland. 
Diane,9 months ago,3,"The jury is ""still out""... Dogs are not as eager to eat right away as they have in the past... however, they do eat after while...... so perhaps they are transitioning their taste buds.... we'll see "
lots o dogs,6 years ago,5,"We have five dogs and they have been on this food for over five years and they are all still alive, These days with all of the recalls of other dog foods that is saying alot. Would recommend highly. "
Linda,3 years ago,5,"Mollie has just started her weight reduction program, but we can already see she has regained a waist.  And the food must taste good to her because she never turns up her nose to it and eats it all. "
Kass,4 years ago,1,My dog has had scabs form since starting him on this food. He does nothing but itch all over. I thought it was just dry skin but now he's losing his hair. I am taking him off this food immediately. 
Elderly,6 years ago,2,"Bought at warehouse; bag filled with crumbs. Called manufacturer  ans they advise return to Costco, but have had same problem with their other varieties too.Never had such in past years of buying. "
MarieK,3 years ago,1,"We purchased this a couple months ago, and within 3 weeks of feeding my almost 15 year old, house trained rescue dog with it, he started losing control of his bowels. Like no warning, just started pooping, and it wasn't diarrhea. It was hard, which I guess I'm thankful for easy cleanup, but once it started, it became a weekly ordeal. We thought maybe it was old age for him, but once I read other reviews about the same loss of control of bowels, I decided to transition him off of it, and now, zero issues with his bowels. Furthermore, I hadn't bagged it up to return yet, and my younger son unknowingly just gave him a big scoop on his day to feed him, and once again, the next day, just pooped under our table where he was sitting. Also vomited that morning, and nothing else makes sense except this food, and for the fact there was a single kibble of this food in his vomit. That confirmed it for us that this just doesn't sit well for our senior canine who is otherwise healthy. Thought the ingredients and price were worth the try, but now I only wish we realized sooner, it wasn't worth the buy. "
hxh1111,5 years ago,5,This is first time I bought this dry food for my lager and overweight Newfoundland dog .She seems like this food and so far haven't seen her any bad reaction such as nausea and diarrhea yet . 
Erika Mitchell,4 years ago,5,"I bought this as recommended for my 2 diabetic dogs. It works great. The only downside, my local Costco doesn’t carry it so I ordered it online. Disappointing to find out it’s $10 more online "
M Jones,4 years ago,5,Great product for my 2 aussies. One needs to drop a few pounds and this food allows for a slow reduction of weight over time. They inhale the stuff! Very pleased with the quality and the price. 
Muffins Dad,2 years ago,5,"My dog absolutely loves this dog food. I was paying more for a 24 lb bag of the “Top of the Line” dog food. However, my dog prefers this food hands down. She eats it as soon as I fill her bowl. "
Tucker,6 years ago,5,We have been buying the healthy weight formula for 2 years now. Have a senior Lab with a bad hip so weight control is important. He apparently  loves the taste and his weight has been stable.

Monica,4 years ago,5,The product is great! I´ve been feeding it to my 3 yr old dog for about a year.  The only inconvenience is that ordering online is just overpriced (about $14 more than at the warehouse) 
Norm,3 years ago,5,I lost my last two Labs at an early age to hip problems. My Vet suggested I give her a Glucosamine supplement with her food. This coupled with the healthy weight ingredients is perfect 
Michelle,5 years ago,5,I have used this food for a long time and am very satisfied with it.  I can now have it sent to my home since there is not Costco in Idaho Falls at this time.  Free Shipping!  Awesome!

xmeyer,a year ago,5,"My MacBook Pro 13"" was about 5 years old.  Tired of the flaky butterfly keyboard, the battery capacity reduced, the camera no longer working in this age of zoom, I went for a new machine.  The base MacBook Air at $999 (a nice Costco deal) is a solid laptop with enough memory and enough storage for anyone who is not a gamer and does not store movies on the machine.  The m2 chip is indeed zippy and runs cool enough (again, not a gamer) that the no-fan design works fine.  The day-to-day experience is great:  excellent keyboard feel; bright, sharp screen; and clear, adequately loud sound.  I think you cannot go wrong with this machine at this price. "
sfdoglover,a year ago,5,"Great basic laptop with all the new bells and whistles. I switched from a late 2013 Macbook Pro, which was on its last legs. Set up and transfer were easy with a Time Machine backup of my old laptop. This new MB Air is lightweight, fast, with long battery life. It took some getting used to the new (to me) form factor; feels a little cheap compared to the heavy built old MB Pro. Also hard to get by with just *two* USB-C ports (and only on the left side) compared to every port I could possibly want on my old MB Pro. Be prepared to buy additional adaptors and such. Got the midnight color, and it looks cool but shows every smudge and fingerprint. "
Dave,a year ago,5,"It was time to upgrade my wife's old MacBookAir once hers was relegated to OS-Monterey. Mine was also getting a little long in the tooth, so we decided new MBAs would be our Christmas gift to each other. It was a very good decision. The new MBAs have the best keyboard I've ever used and that includes the M2 MacBookPro that I use to record audio/video clips). The screen is vivid - a big upgrade. The battery lasts all day (15 hours+). I love the new midnight case - my D-I-L remarked that she had never seen a black Apple before -- ""it's about time!"" she said. And lastly, the M2 GPU is extremely fast for the applications I use including large and complex Excel spreadsheets. "
SittingBull,a year ago,5,"I purchased this computer for working remotely. All I needed is WEB browsing, remote desktop and VPN...I used it also to watch YouTube.It worked really well across the board. Closing the flip make the computer go sleep and opening the flip wake it up immediately!I personally don't like much the build in mouse, instead I bought a simple Logitech mouse on AMZN for $35. It worked great!The only thing I didn't manage to figure out yet is the fingerprint login feature.Might be that my prints are kind of not stable, but this is not a real issue.Also if the bove is all you need, I don't see a real reason to buy the more expensive MacBook Pro... "
Arun J,2 years ago,5,"This is my first MacBook and definitely not my last. I don't know why I waited as long to make the switch from my PC but I'm glad I finally did. I'm already in the Apple ecosystem so there was minimal learning curve and as is with Apple products, it just works. I love the sleek design of the M2 MacBook Air and the responsiveness. I highly recommend this product! Also, Costco's price was lower than the Apple store, which made buying from Costco a no brainer "
SBSERENITY,a year ago,5,"So far it's good enough. I had to replace a 2-year old Air that was having issues. I know, it didn't last as long as I had hoped, but maybe it was just an outlier for the newer Macs? I hope so! I have been using Macs since the late 1980s and have been mostly satisfied over the years. Anyway, my partner bought a Pro and I bought an Air (both with the M2 chip). All in all they are about the same except her battery seems to last longer. If I am fully charged in the morning, by the time I finish work in the early evening, I need to recharge. That seems a little bit short for a charge, but it is better than the one that I had, and it works for my purposes. Finally I chose the Midnight color just to change things up a bit and to easily differentiate it from the other Mac laptops in the house; I like it. "
Andrew,a year ago,4,"I have multiple MacBooks but this particular model replaced an older Macbook Pro that I have had for years. This laptop works excellently, is lightweight, quiet (no noisy fan) and has wonderful battery life. I primarily use windows, but use my Macbooks for work.  The only minor downsides I have are the anemic amount of ram, the 60hz display, and so-so speakers when compared to larger laptops. These are small tradeoffs to make for something so portable and will likely not be noticed in day to day use.  This is a wonderful productivity device for non-intensive workloads. "
Cody,2 years ago,5,This thing makes my 5 year old MacBook Pro feel like a stone tablet in comparison.  Battery only needs to be charged every few days.  Light as a feather with a great screen.  These new M series processors from Apple can't be beat as every task I throw at it happens near instantly. 
DaveUWS,a year ago,3,"This is a lovely machine, but I was surprised that this unit with the new M2 chip seems sluggish compared to my older Air with the M1 chip. However, I watched a tear-down site online and apple has switched from dual-channel RAM access and dual-channel storage access to single channel for both if you buy the 8GB RAM and 256GB storage version. It doesn't matter how fast the CPU is if both RAM and storage speeds are cut in half. "
David,a year ago,2,"Please read about the problems with the 256gb ssd in this mac before you buy. They are slower than the previous generation’s 256gb ssd bc they are just one ssd instead of two 128gb ssds.  It is also soldered in so you can’t change it out.  With only 8gb of RAM you will occasionally be writing to the ssd drive which will decrease its lifespan over the long run.  I bought a previous generation m1 MacBook Air (256gb ssd 16gb RAM) at the same time and though it doesn’t look as nice out of the box, and is an m1 chip instead of the m2, it performs better.  Even though it was ~200 dollars more,  I  have more piece of mind that my ssd will last longer.  The difference in display resolution is not noticeable to me and the space gray m1 does not show fingerprint smudges like this midnight m2 does.   I will be returning this one but if I were set on getting an m2 I would pay extra for upgraded 16gb RAM and get one of the other colors that don’t show fingerprints. "
Vega,2 years ago,5,First time Mac user so can’t compare to previous model. I like the long battery life. MagSafe connection is great. Very little learning curve. Best part is purchasing from Costco. Cheaper & extended warranty. Now I just need to look for a thunderbolt docking station. 
STEVEN,a year ago,3,"Nice size and great specs with 8+8cores CPU/GPU.  But the 256GB is way too small for today’s use…like buying a 16GB iPhone in the past.  The 8GB RAM is another big constraint.  Despite the seemingly strong specs (other than RAM and HDD), the M2Air doesn’t like heavy load; especially when running multiple apps.  Slows down tremendously.  Good only for patient folks with no need for heavy computing. "
bumblebeelatte,9 months ago,3,"I love that Costco makes it super easy to purchase.  I received my computer super quick - the next day.  I realized afterwards that this model has the M2 chip, but the running memory is only 256GB of storage and 8GB RAM.  With some quick research, I found out that some were questioning  whether this is enough.  For me, it is not.  I keep many tabs open and a few browsers open for personal use and work.  I find that it is sluggish at times.  Just enough to be annoying. I know it is the computer because I did not have this problem with my older MAC with a M1 and more memory.  Costco is good at have upgraded items at a great price and I didn't do my due dilagence and research it.  The good news is, I think I may return it and see if there is a MAC laptop with higher memory.  Costco has such a great return policy. "
kato,2 years ago,5,Great product.Buying from Costco was cheaper that from Apple and extra year of warranty was included. 
Jacob,2 years ago,5,The laptop meets all my expectations and then some. As for the color choices I went with midnight. I looks sweet but the amount of finger prints and any other dirt grime it shows is rather annoying. I would go with space gray if given another chance. 
Donaldw1937,a year ago,4,"Just as a way of introducing myself: I worked for the Detroit News for nearly 40 years, the last 15 or so as Computer Coordinator. We use basically Apple computers for Graphics, etc. The one that is described in this interview is as described.  I have been retired for 22 years and have forgotten more than I ever knew, ha, ha. This is my fourth Apple computer and have been more than satisfied with all of them. They seem to be more troublefree than the PC's plus the fact that there are telephone numbers that can be called to talk to peopleabout problems and there is no charge for trouble shooting. There are numerous ""help people"", buta lot of the time they seem to be reading from an trouble shooting handbook or something. The only downside, in my opinion is the fact that the beloved Apple engineers seem to make improvements that are fairly arcane to an Old Fogey like me. I am 85 and have some difficulty in sorting through all the changes; almost to the point that I was giving serious thought to retiring thecomputer to Costco. But I aim still slogging along trying to make sense of all the ""improvements""that have been made and still think highly of Apple "
n2wind2000,2 years ago,5,"Everything I was hoping for, in replacing my 10+ yr old Macbook Pro. Apple quality, durability, lightning speed and ease of use. Simple automated data transferring from older equipment, Apple made this so easy to upgrade with zero headache or hassle. Costco makes it even easier with an additional 12mo. of warranty on top of Apples manufacture warranty. "
dimes4slim,a year ago,5,"Apple never disappoints. This was a replacement for my 9 year old Macbook Air which was running short on memory. I never got more than 5 years with a Windows laptop, so even though this Macbook Air was more expensive, the quality and longevity more than made up the price difference. "
BamBam,2 years ago,5,"I was worried that it may struggle with only 8GB of ram, but not at all. This laptop is super fast even with dozens of browser tabs open. "
Vince20151,4 months ago,5,"I've never owned or used a MacBook before. Thought I treat myself buying one of these. Oh boy indeed all the rave reviews are true. This is true quality. The material, the screen, accessories. Love everything about it. Only that a few of iPad apps are not available. But when it is not, I can resort to using it the app on the browser. For example, Netflix is not so I use netflix.com. Still trying to get used to the interface and file systems but so far love everything about it. Well, except the lack of ports. There are only 2 USB - C ports so if you need more, you'd have to invest in a USB hub. "
Adam,2 years ago,5,"Screen is amazing. Battery life is great, I've been using it for three days and haven't charged it yet. Build quality seems on par with other apple products. Really the only negative so far is it's a fingerprint magnet, however, nothing a case won't fix. "
kris817,2 years ago,5,I was replacing a 6 year old MacBook Air that was randomly shutting down and becoming very slow with this new one in Midnight.  I love the color and it is so fast compared to my old one.  Glad I finally decided to buy it. 
Emma J,a year ago,5,"Replaced my 2012 MacBook Pro. Love the upgrades in technology, speed, ease of use, and the lightweight feel is perfect! I am on my computer a lot, working with Word, Excel, Photos, and various other apps. This computer handles everything I need seamlessly. "
RottenApple,11 months ago,2,"I did a 2 hour troubleshooting session with Apple and they determined it was a hardware failure (this included doing a partition and creating a new account). Returned it. 1 star for how great it was until then and 1 star for Costco's great return policy. It was never dropped but, it is designed (as seen in the pictures) to be opened by the top part of the screen right where the camera is. I wonder how many others had this failure. "
Jason,a year ago,3,Great computer but really disappointing that the SSD is so slow for a $1200 laptop and only 8 gb of RAM. It's a shame the premium you pay with such a limitiation. 
Lena,2 years ago,5,Great computer. My 9th grader is very happy. Fingers print unlock button is so convenient 
High class Cheapskate,4 months ago,3,"It took me a long time to save up for and even longer to decide on the 13.6” M2 Air, after ruling out the 15” M2 Air and the iMac 24”.  About two weeks in I noticed that speeds slowed I randomly and then this week it started freezing up on me. I discovered that it’s an issue specific to the 13” M2 Air 256MB, and it’s well documented on the web. Huge bummer.  Luckily, I have about two weeks left before my 90 day. It ends for returning it to Costco. I am so grateful that I chose to buy it at Costco. Exactly for this reason. Otherwise, I would’ve been stuck with it. I think I’m gonna go with the 24 inch iMac this time, I ended up buying an external Apple Magic Keyboard with touch ID and number pad for economics so I might as well just buy the desktop and use my iPad more often.  I hope that other people are aware of this issue, though I hope more that nobody has to do with it. Godspeed. "
Nikhil,11 months ago,3,"I like this new MacBook Air. It is light weight and sleek. However, I am noticing that my MacBook freezes often whenever I wake it from sleep. The machine fails to reload web pages and redirects to ‘update your browser’ window even though I have the most updated version of safari and OS. "
JChen,2 years ago,3,The speed of the SSD on this M2 chip MacBook Air is only 50% of the M1 MacBook Air. I see no overall performance improvement. 
Andrea,6 months ago,5,"I have had Apple products since 1985, and despite the relatively high cost, they have made my life easier than it would be with PCs.  I love that all my devices are connected.  This model is a bit smaller in circumference than my 2013 Macbook Air, but the screen size is the same.  It's lightweight and compact, making it easy to transport.  The battery promises to last 18 hours, which is essential for me.  (The only reason I chose to buy a new Macbook was that the battery of the older model has pretty much died.)  I use my laptop for online  teaching, zoom meetings, emails, and photo editing--it's perfect for me. "
ET Aurora,a year ago,4,Exactly as advertised but would benefit from additional ports. Snobbish to require add-ons 
Sarah,2 years ago,5,"I was debating getting the pro, which I didn't need. I'm so glad I didn't because the M2 air is all I've ever wanted. The battery lasts me the entire day if not another. It's perfect for my on-the-go self and the speed is unbeatable. No glitching Touch Bar anymore, sayonara pro. "
Medium,2 years ago,5,"Superior speed and intuitive user interface, excellent screen clarity, impressive sound, incomparable overall feel and style "
David,a year ago,5,Great modern Mac. Best value of the apple products offered currently. Extremely fast and so nice. 
Anil V,a year ago,5,"I replaced my old Macbook 13 Pro from 2014 with Macbook Air M2. I have an iPad Pro M1 and this is much better and practical than iPad. My biggest gripe with iPad is that it is functional only with an expensive keyboard case and still doesn't offer desktop experience, whereas Macbook Air is portable, light and very much practical with lot of battery. This model has dedicated Magsafe 3 port for charging which leaves one USB-C port for other uses. It comes with Magsafe 3 30W white charger with odd looking black cable. I appreciate the inclusion of TouchID for quick authentication. The trackpad and keyboard is very good. It has a larger screen and lighter than Macbook Air M1, Macbook Pro 13. However on the downside, none of my existing USB peripherals work. I'm going to purchase USB-C dock to hook up monitor, keyboard, mouse dongles etc. Second issue is that it is a fingerprint magnet. It has dirty fingerprints all over the surface within no time. Third issue is that in-built webcam is very soft, grainy and lack quality. I wish there is at least one USB port for the backward compatibility. For the given price and exceptional value it provides, I would strongly recommend it for anybody. "
David,a year ago,1,"MacBook would NOT power up. Called CONCEIRGE and Apple support. No luck. Costco return process was good, although still waiting for credit. Where is Apple’s quality control? "
hello,a year ago,1,"I received the product with dead battery, which is not common, and never happened to me and I have purchased multiple mac products. I may have received a product with defective battery so I now need to go through warranty/exchange process. "
William,8 months ago,1,"When I started the laptop, the cursor would not move. Restarting it did not help. I contacted Apple support and was told to take it to the Apple Store. Person at the Apple Store diagnosed the problem to be a non functioning trackpad. They recommended I return the laptop to Costco. I returned it and was reimbursed. Please make arrangements with me to replace this defective laptop with a new, functioning  machine at the sale price I paid. "
David,11 months ago,1,After five months has a one and a half inch bar down the middle of the screen. 
Lulu,2 years ago,5,"This new MacBook Air is fabulous! Quick, better ergnomics, love the new gold/silver color!  So far, so great! "
NashvilleBrit,a year ago,5,"Great price and secure buying from my favorite store. Bigger and brighter screen, much better keys, lighter and faster. Also like the dark grey. The best change is the re emergence of the MagSafe power connector, so much better than the useless USB C. "
MSUL,a year ago,5,Glad I bought this at Costco instead of Apple- got the rebate on the product instead of an apple gift card.  My MacBook Pro was from 2009 and I couldn't get on any websites and it was SLOW.  This is just what I need for the simple things I do online. 
Blackbelt2008,4 months ago,5,"I’m very happy with my purchase! I’ve been waiting for a good deal since last year and when I saw it in one of the branches of Costco that I usually go that it was on sale I decided to buy and get it delivered. The price was right, delivery was on time as promised, and the performance of the computer is great. The price came with a two-year warranty as well that you can’t find anywhere. "
Caroline H,6 months ago,1,"I bought this laptop on 11/17/23, and within 1 month it can not type some letter on keyboard, I am really upset. "

Able to move around my home from office for Zoom, checking emails, etc., to casual watching movies snuggled on my couch.  And when I travel it's perfect. Hope this helps knowing how satisfied I am! "
Spark,a year ago,5,"Congratulations on your new MacBook Air M2! I'm glad to hear that you chose this laptop. The MacBook Air M2 is a great choice for anyone looking for a powerful and reliable laptop. The 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD storage are perfect for everyday use, and the M2 chip ensures that you can run all your favorite apps and programs with ease. One of the best things about the MacBook Air M2 is its battery life. You can use it for hours on end without having to worry about running out of power. The laptop is also very lightweight and easy to carry around, making it perfect for people who are always on the go. Overall, I think the MacBook Air M2 is a great laptop that offers excellent performance and reliability. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a new laptop. Enjoy your new MacBook Air M2! "
Beachdudes,a year ago,1,Overall computer works well but not having a HDMI port makes it difficult when traveling and using different monitors. After spending $1000 why should I be forced to buy additional hardware just to make it work. 
Bob C,3 months ago,5,"I've been really liking my MacBook Air Apple M2 Laptop so far! I do a lot of audio work for my job and having a noiseless fan for hours of recording really is helpful to get crisp and clean results. It's also good for school work as well for any students who are looking for a laptop for their studies, highly recommend! "
BeachLady,a year ago,5,"Mac. What's not to like? This is my first foray out of PC Microsoft world, and after a short learning curve, I'm loving it. I'll admit to wanting a Mac ever since the MacAir debuted in the manilla folder. It was a treat for myself.The M2 handles what I use it for: email, browsing, image editing (GIMP) very well. The battery life is terrific and it doesn't overheat like my PC did. It's lightweight, which was important to me for traveling. The camera is rated higher than the M1 and the chip is faster.The migration from PC to Mac went well. I could keep using OneDrive and DropBox, as well as ICloud. I have an iPhone and I'm delighted at how the Mac and iPhone interact. I can get my texts and calls automatically on the Mac.Love the color. I went with the gold. It's quite subtle and doesn't show fingerprints. "
Amber,2 years ago,5,"I bought this laptop for my senior in HS so he could get his college essays done and have a laptop for school. He is loving it! Only downfall is, it is not touch screen, in this day and age everything is so we expected it to be touchscreen. "
Liz B,5 months ago,5,I’m very pleased with my new MacBook Air! I have wanted one for a long time and just kept putting it off and decided for my 70th birthday I was going to get what for me I love the speed the graphics are great. It was easy to learn to use because I already have an iPhone just perfection. 
Kendra,a year ago,5,"The battery life is absolutely unbelievable. I use the computer primarily on evenings and weekends as my personal computer, often browsing various sites, but sometimes streaming shows, or chatting with friends over zoom. I usually don't have to charge for 3-5 days. It's lightweight, comfortable to type on, the trackpad is great... everything about the M2 MacBook air is just a pleasure to use. It was great to get a slight discount buying through Costco, too! "
Do BI,2 years ago,4,Love it. It replaces a older Mac book. So light and fast. Bought for business. Just wish for touch screen 
Mr Bad Surface,a year ago,1,Lost internet connectivity regularly. Could not stay on zoom calls. Returned product. 
Jerome,a year ago,5,"This MacBook Air was a huge upgrade from my 8 year old intel-based MacBook Air.  This laptop can run many applications at once and have 25+ tabs open in Safari & Firefox without slowing down.  Ignore the reviews from the tech critics out there saying that the base model isn't good enough.  I think this laptop is just fine for the average user who surfs the web, works in MS Word, does some light photo editing, plays a few games, etc.  With an external hard drive, 256 storage is fine if you store files on the cloud and/or have an external hard drive.   I'm also glad this MacBook Air can connect to my 8-year old (but still surprisingly good) Apple Thunderbolt Display (with a $35 adapter). Finally, the sleek & minimalist design made the upgrade worth it for me alone.  It's a joy to carry around this laptop -- carrying it with the lid closed, it feels like an iPad in your hand.  The midnight color is gorgeous, even though it attracts fingerprints unlike anything I've seen (I just embrace the fingerprints now haha).  Keyboard and trackpad feel premium. "
Ronnie,a year ago,5,"This MacBook Air is VERY FAST.  The software easily connects with an older computer and transferred files and applications seamlessly and automatically.  It may take a while though depending on the amount of data to be transferred.  The USB-C ports are also very fast - but here are the WORTS:  There are only 2 USB-C ports, and NO OTHERS!  They are too close together for some interface adaptors, USB-C to older USB OTC connectors. Because the computer only has 2 USC-C ports, a USB-C Hub is needed to connect the computer with SD micro cards, other devices with older USB and HDMU connectors.  The great advantage Apple has over other PC's is the computer's plug-and-play capability, a feature that eliminates a lot of user frustration! "
Dani,5 months ago,5,One of the best Macs I’ve ever owned. My wife bought one of these from the Apple Store last year and she loves hers so much that she bought this one for me when she saw it was on sale. I needed a new computer and I’m incredibly satisfied with the purchase. It is fast. Sleek. Looks great. Love the new charging port. I don’t know too much computer lingo but I can tell there is a significant improvement with this Mac over previous versions.

Sharon,8 months ago,5,"I have an old MacBook Air that I bought in 2006 which my grandson confiscated so I bought this MacBook Air & couldn’t be more pleased. Setup was so easy & all my iCloud stuff downloaded quickly. It’s almost like using my old one, but faster & smarter. Lots of new perks that were easy for me to figure out. I love Apple products because of the user friendly interface & ease of use! Apple frustrates me with all the updates sometimes but never disappoints 🍎 "
Angelo,6 months ago,5,Amazing 
DaleS,6 months ago,5,"The Apple MacBook Air M2 is a great basic travel computer for the following reasons: 18 hours battery life, dimensional size and weight, and connectivity to most existing cloud and hard storage data files.  It also worked well on my existing lighting cable docking unit. The unit lacks pen, touch screen and multiple monitor support.  Also non Apple Music and Video files requires downloading a third party player. Over all I’m very happy with my purchase. "
Paige,a year ago,5,miss the touchscreen but not the slow start-up and constant updates of windows. 
Bobster,6 months ago,5,"Purchased as a replacement for an aging 2015 Macbook Pro. Construction is sturdy and elegant. Nice action on the keyboard. This laptop is faster than me, has a very nice display, long battery life and does not get hot in spite of having no cooling fan. I am using it for standard productivity apps, not high-end gaming or graphics. While it has only 2 USB-C ports for peripherals, a hub with additional USB-C, legacy USB-A and HDMI is very inexpensive. "
T and TL,a year ago,1,"Failed OS, product returned for refund. "
chau,a year ago,4,The main problem I've had with this MacBook Air is the charging unit coming loose constantly. I don't know if this is a problem with all MacBook Airs or if I got a dud! 
Al Sigman,a year ago,4,"computer is very nice and fast.  I replaced a MacBook Pro which was 13 years old with this MacBokk Air.  The only difficulty I had was the migration of data from old to new computer, but finally got the hang of it done.  A bit of learning curve with the the Air.  Getting better every day and I am satisfied that in the coming weeks I will feel more comfortable with  Air.  Glad I made the change and would recomend the Air over the Pro. "
NaplesNorm,6 months ago,3,"The product itself was just as advertised and the delivery was actually early. However, It had been promoted as a Black Friday Deal with a $50 deduction taken at checkout. The $50 credit was not issued in spite of my pointingout to customer service that it clearly was offfered by send in screen shots from their website.  Customer service agent referred me to a supervisor wjo so far has no had the curtesy to even reply to my request. "
greenpia,7 months ago,5,"Can $1000 notebook be bargain? This MacBook is. This is first time I ever purchased Apple notebook. I have had varies notebook PC from Dell, HP, Acer, Lenovo, etc. I am never going back to Window PC. Simply amazing quality. Workmanship is beyond approach. Everything works fast and perfectly. Material & design is so far ahead of competition. So thin and light. Wow.... Most impressive product I ever purchased in many decades! "
Gramma17,6 months ago,5,"A gift for my granddaughter Ryann's high school graduation.  I also got one 2 years ago for her sister, Hayley.  It's something their mom would have wanted for them - she passed away a year ago.    Hayley feels it is invaluable to her as pre-med at University of Illinois. "
BQ52,8 months ago,5,"My older MacBook laptop was no longer functioning with the battery, so it always needed to be plugged into AC. The potential cost to replace the battery was significant, and it was old enough that it could not accept new updates. This was the ideal replacement. The process (thank you, Apple) to open the new one with my Apple ID and transfer the information worked well. I am very pleased with this newer MacBook Air. "
Greg,a year ago,2,Slow performance 
Susan,4 months ago,3,While I love the laptop -I had to be on the phone for two support hours thru Costco to determine that it needed updating.My friend bought theirs the same day from another retailer and it was updated…I was not happy about this. 
Dave F,6 months ago,5,"On sale at Costco.  Opted for 8Gb memory which has been completely fine.  Light as a feather, powerful battery, crisp screen, and decent keyboard.  Missing the number keypad, but it would have made it wider.  Fingerprint recognition is a definite plus.  Can't go wrong for the price.  Performance has been great.  Plans were to use for internet, email, taxes, etc.  No gaming or video editing. "
a2z451,10 months ago,4,"as expected and the migration from old to new was almost seamless.  The only thing I am less then pleased with is the cost, 30% more than an a Windows laptop with similar specifications. "
Anonymous,a month ago,5,"Apple MacBook Air came well packaged, brand new and works exceptionally well. My first Mac very easy to get up and running. Extremely fast laptop at a great price. Only next time would be to better manage expectations on delivery date. Was confirmed delivery on a certain date and it arrived two days past that date. Bonus at Costco you get one extra year of warranty! "
Spedelover,10 months ago,5,I mean it’s a MacBook Air?  Do I need to write a review?   It’s awesome.  Our 5th MacBook and this one does not change our expectations of Mac products. 
Kevin W,a year ago,5,"I highly recommend buying this computer.  I never had a Mac before, but I don't think I could ever go back to pc. It integrates so well with my iPhone.  I love texting from my Mac, taking phone calls, and syncing things like bookmarks and pictures.  The computer is very fast and the battery life is the best I have ever seen. The M2 chip is the real deal. "
sfnm,a year ago,2,Don't sell computers so OLD that they are NOT worth the $50 less. 
J Bach,10 months ago,5,"Perfect personal laptop. Not too big or small. TouchID enabled makes logging in simple.  Of course if you have other apple products, this makes it easy to exchange data.  My only gripe is that they changed the power outlet plug from prior models.  It forces users to buy more accessories if the one it comes with gets damaged or lost. "

It shipped in a nondescript box, which made me feel better about it sitting on my front porch for an hour or so. Will definitely look at Costco for other electronics in the future! "
Susie,7 months ago,5,So far it has been great.  My old one was 12 years old and spinning all the time so needed to get new laptop to keep up with technology.  Keyboard has a nice touch and power lasts for a couple days with minimum use. I chose darker color to make noticeable difference from hubbies. In general very pleased 
Lane B,a year ago,5,Great choice! Shipped quickly with lots of communication so I knew where it was. Trade in was super easy. My new Mac runs great it’s an amazing upgrade from my old 2018.

Lemonhead14,4 months ago,5,"Fair price for everything I need in a laptop. I’m not a super techy person. However, I do want my tools to work as they should.

Grammy,a year ago,4,"Ordered the laptop and it was delivered the next day. I thought I made a mistake when Imopened the package and it was silver. Today, I saw that I did order the Starlight. Too late to return it but I wNted to let you know. The laptop is great and I appreciate the prompt delivery. "
CPN745,a year ago,5,"Very easy to configure and update, especially if you have previously used any Apple product. The case is sturdy and operation is silent.

HappyJo,10 months ago,5,"I just upgraded my 9 year old MacBook Air for this new one and was amazed how easy it was to transfer emails, texts, photos and Apps to the new MacBook.  The only two things I would improve is for the MacBook to be touch screen capable and for it to have a slot for a scan disk. "
bwdeca,a year ago,5,"Great laptop. I’m replaced a MacBook Pro 2015 with m2 air. Patioally because I love the now-back-again magnetic charge connector. Anyway, the m2 air seems plenty speedy to handle the photoshop stuff I do. I like the “midnight color “ but it picks up lots of fingerprints. "

Charles Burnham,a year ago,5,"This is a gorgeous computer (I chose Starlight, which is a lovely metallic champagne), thoughtfully designed in every detail (even the power cord) and beautifully packaged. The quality is exemplary throughout. The computer is thin and lightweight but sturdy, and completely silent. It boots almost immediately and the battery  life is great -- all enormous improvements over my old Dell laptop.I like the trackpad despite being used to a mouse. I am currently testing two bluetooth mice and have had no issues with lag or dropped connections. I chose this Macbook Air after reading many reviews and testing the same style of keyboard on a Macbook Pro. I was a little worried about the size, but thanks to the small bezel, the screen and keyboard are not much smaller than on my old widescreen 15"" Dell laptop. The keyboard was one of my main criteria, and it is a pleasure to use. The help documentation is excellent -- I have found it easy to migrate to this machine and to customize it to my liking.  It is an absolute pleasure to use. Before purchasing, I tested an alternative to Quicken for Windows and for my purposes, Moneydance was a good choice because it can import QIF files.  So far, I cannot find anything to disappoint. I love it! "
