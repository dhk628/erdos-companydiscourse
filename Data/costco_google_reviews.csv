If not, (e.g. you and your husband share the same Costco account, you scan your copy of the membership card but he pays) and the attendant notices, they will void your transaction and make you start all over again using that person’s issue of the membership card. Yes, even if it is from the same account.

I unfortunately found this out today while shopping with my mother for last-minute items for our family Easter party. I scanned my membership card at check out and the attendant came over to scan our larger items. I told the attendant, “Oh, the case of beer is my mother’s,” and beckoned for my mom to take out her ID so she can scan it if need be.

The employee then stopped our transaction and asked whose membership we were using. I replied that it is my membership but my mother carries the second card associated with my account. She then weirdly caught an attitude with us and told us that since the beer is my mother’s, that my mother will be paying for the transaction and that we will have to start all over again after my mom scans her own issue of the card. My mother asked, “Even if our cards are from the same account?” And the attendant cut her off and snapped back, “YES, even if the cards are from the same account, because the cards have different ending numbers!”

Had the attendant not been so eager to void our transaction, she would have noticed that I had already taken out my own ID for her to scan for the beer so we wouldn’t have to start the check-out process over. (I had already planned on paying for all of my family’s Easter groceries at the end anyway… So yes, my membership, my card, my money.)

I understand that since I said the beer was my mother’s, that she would have to be the one to purchase it. I also understand that it has been a busy holiday weekend and that she was probably having a stressful shift. But the attitude towards us was misplaced and voiding our transaction just to scan another card that is linked to the same account and having to start over was an overreaction.

Four months of shopping here reduces five stars to two. Terrible beef prices (go to Winco for proteins of quality and good price), rotten seafood once, moldy bagels, mis-labeled meat, lame customer service. Still useful store for things you don't eat.

PREVIOUS POST
Just joined today. Great Costco, good selection across the board. Even proteins can be reasonably priced if you look. The store guess on and on (pic.), the butcher is highly competent (pic.) of him breaking down a whole animal) - and rivals the cuts you see at Whole Foods, not Safeway or Fred Meyer's. I got a hot dog and a drink for my voyage through the aisles, and that set me back only $1.50!! (pic.). The CEO of Costco announced laspping  September at an earnings meeting that this price is ""forever"" - which is good because I spent $665+ here today (pic.) and bought 50 things, bringing my avg. cost per item $13.30.

Kast's Tip: Join today and spring for the Executive Membership which is twice as much as Gold ($120 vs. $60). An average couple should get around $200/year in cashback, in addition to other benefits. If you think you spend about average, or have more than two people in your home, it just makes sense!",1684089927,False

I generally don’t leave a 1 star review unless something is extremely bad as is the case of this Costco.

This store has extremely rude and passive aggressive employees who go out of their way to be antagonistic-especially at the front entrance. The employees are disrespectful towards the customers to an extent I’ve never witnessed in any retail store, much less the Costco brand-which is known for friendlier employees.

On site management seems pretty dense on the issue and treats any complaint as “two different sides” of the customer versus the employee. What the management should be doing is holding any employees accountable for unnecessarily rude behavior and looking at reasons of why a customer would go out of their way to complain.

I will be avoiding this Costco despite it being most convenient for me. If other Costcos start to become mismanaged the same way moving forward, I’ll cancel my membership that I’ve had for 25 years.

Clean, well kept Costco with easy access off the freeway. Decent selection of products, friendly staff. Like most other stores they always seem to have holiday stuff in stock way too early (Christmas stuff after Labor day? Why, yes they do!) They're usually totally out by the time the season actually rolls around. Still, they had some cool stuff if you didn't mind the fact it was several months too early but it's mostly sold out by the time the holiday is near. The staff is helpful and the selection of products overall is still good.

The pharmacy staff is polite and helpful. I have some allergies and they always take the time to check the ingredients of every medication and make sure that it's safe for me. If the one in stock is not, they look for one that is an order that.

The tire center has great prices on tires and batteries, their prices on batteries are the cheapest in town. If a battery goes bad, they'll under the warranty and refund you the price you paid for it (or a prorated price if you're in the prorated time frame of the warranty). You only pay the difference in price if the battery has gone up in price. For tires, they will not run bigger tires than OEM or put tires on with a different speed rating, so if you're trying to run BFG KO2 tires or the like keep that in mind, as they likely won't do it. Also, they did damage the OEM wheels on a Corolla I used to own when I purchased Michelin tires from here. So keep that in mind and check your wheels before and after getting tires.

Nice selection of TVs at good prices. No delivery, but they've never offered delivery. The Food Court still has the same great prices it's always had. Membership is $60/year, so you get a lot of value for the price you pay.",1711943015,False

The arena of valor? None other than Costco, the colossal cathedral of consumption.

Our tale begins in the dim light of dawn, with our intrepid shopper, armed with a membership card sharper than Excalibur, arriving at the gates of Costco at the hour of 8, a full thirty minutes before the battle begins. The quest was simple, or so it seemed: to venture forth and secure three sacred artifacts, items of legendary repute and uncanny value.

But, ah! The path of a hero is never straight, nor is it ever devoid of temptation. For upon the opening of the gates, a siren song of deals and discounts filled the air, leading our hero astray. The first challenge: a mountainous display of electronics, whispering sweet nothings of high definition and infinite connectivity. With a steely gaze, our hero resists... only to fall victim to a fortress of fleece blankets, softer than the clouds of Olympus and just as inviting. One magically leaps into the cart, a stowaway on the journey.

The odyssey continues, through the treacherous terrain of sample stations, where sirens with hairnets and plastic gloves offer morsels of ambrosia—bite-sized temptations that ensnare our hero longer than anticipated. Each sample, a feast fit for the gods, yet leaving our protagonist yearning for more. The cart begins to fill, not with the sought-after artifacts but with goods of unspeakable delight and questionable necessity.

In the heart of the labyrinth, our hero encounters the clothing section, a realm where logic and reason battle against bargains and bulk. Here, the second cart joins the fray, summoned by the call of cargo pants that double as shorts—a garment of such utility it could only be forged in the fires of convenience.

As the clock ticks, the realization dawns: the three original items, the very purpose of this quest, have eluded capture. Yet, our hero stands at the checkout, not with the modest bounty of three but with two carts brimming with the spoils of adventure—a veritable treasure trove that includes everything from a kayak (for those just-in-case aquatic escapades) to a 72-pack of batteries (because one never knows).

The journey concludes, not with the triumphant acquisition of the sought-after three but with a cornucopia of unintended treasures. Our hero exits through the hallowed halls of Costco, pushing forth the chariots of plenty, a testament to the unpredictability of quests and the irresistible allure of bulk-buy bargains.

Thus ends the tale, a comical saga of ambition, distraction, and the universal truth that in the grand adventure of Costco, one does not simply buy what one intends. No, in this land of plenty, the carts are never half full, and the list is just a suggestion—a parchment to be ignored in favor of the epic, the unexpected, and the utterly inexplicable.",1712202666,False

That would be, how I describe the place in two words. You sign up, become a member, pay your yearly fee and it used to just be that you show your card at the door, but now they want you to show your card at the door, show to a extra person at self check out Who has nothing to do with the checkout process ( which is the only way to quickly get through check out because they don’t have many registers open anymore) and of course, stand in a line, sometimes quite long so they can look at your receipt. Overall, the place makes you feel like a criminal just for shopping there. Selection is pretty good and the prices are OK, not amazing. I find it annoying that the only interaction you have with employees is to check your papers and if you actually are looking for one to try and help find something, it’s difficult to find one. When I asked why they have so many checkpoints I’m given the generic response that they’re worried about other people using someone’s card. Yet if they were that worried, perhaps they should implement a different system, or better yet open more registers.",1714939376,False

Regular price is $10.69 so it’s a great deal. It’s an item I’ve never seen before but another shopper said it’s so good so of course I had to get a bag. Their regular prices are very good , but when they have sakes, prices can’t be beat.

Today, they also had a couple events going on- jewelry and Candy & Chocolate Coz dipped apples- 3 of them for $13.99 which is a great price.

If I could give it zero stars I would. My partner and I pay the fees, renew and maintain the memberships, and frequent the stores. Everyone knows the boycott situation with Walmart due to the receipt police after self check out. But nobody talks about the insane helicopter Costco employees by the check out and even throughout the store. I understand showing your membership card for entry. You have to verify that I'm a member before entry… that’s totally okay. I understand checking the receipt upon exiting to make sure the item count is correct… I completely understand.
But I was asked to show my membership card again while shopping in the clothes. Again while standing in the self checkout line. Again when we got to the kiosk.
A woman walked up and grabbed the scan gun to start scanning my items. I said nothing but Once she saw my face she stepped back as if to allow me to continue. She never put the scan gun back for customer use so I then had to take all the groceries out of the cart then scan and put them on the scale and then back in the cart.(considering it’s self check out shouldn’t the customer be able to use the scan gun to scan my own items? If I wanted an associate to scan them I would go to a line with a cashier).  She then stood there and stared at me to insure I didn’t skip scanning any items. (Isn’t that why they check the receipt at the door?) (if the concern was theft, why did Costco implement self checkout?)

Previously, I asked the associate who verified my membership “is there a reason they check for memberships after entry and prior to check out?”
She said absolutely there is… it’s to ensure other family members are not using the membership because when they do prices go up. Her example was they don’t want daughters using mom’s membership. I understand they believe it will stop daughter from using moms membership when moms not there. Realistically this doesn’t change anything, whether mom is present with daughter or daughter shops alone with moms card… daughter still will not have membership and shop and the groceries will go home with whoever.
Checking memberships over and over is not going to stop family members from using others memberships…. It’s only going to upset other customers and derive them from shopping here. Just it did with us today.",1714867430,False

I have never felt so offended and treated like a thief in my entire life.

As a Costco Executive member for over 20 years, today marked the absolute worst experience I have ever had at Costco. Solomon made me feel discriminated against and like a petty thief.

I visited the standalone Savvy Cie Jewels section today to purchase jewelry for my wife as a Mother's Day gift. After selecting the items, I received a ticket to take to the cashier to be paid for. I proceeded to pay for the jewelry along with three other items. Cashier said I have to go back to pick up my paid items so I did. I exited the store, and returned to collect my purchased items.

As I re-entered, Solomon the greeter hesitantly ask me what am I doing? I explained, I came back to pick up my paid items he unpolitely told me to placed my shopping cart at the entrance which I did. Being very bothered by his attitude, I proceeded to pick up my purchased Savvy Jewelry.After picking up my items I headed towards the exit to retrieve my shopping cart, Solomon questioned my actions again(I felt a little harassed). I patiently reiterated, that I was simply there to collect the jewelry I had already paid for. To support my explanation, I displayed my receipts and the two purple jewelry bags, which are only given to customers who have shown their paid receipts to Savvy representatives. He insisted on seeing my receipt again. I showed him my paid receipts. Despite presenting my receipts and the two purple bags containing my merchandise, Solomon continued to detain me, causing me to be late for an appointment.

He insisted on searching my bags multiple times, causing a further delay and more frustration. Even after I requested to leave due to my appointment, he refused, stating he was just doing his job.

I felt extremely unjustly treated and discriminated against. Solomon's behavior was unacceptable, especially considering him detaining me for such a long time. I have never experienced such disrespect and disappointment at Costco before.

Solomon's lack of customer service skills, rudeness, discriminative and not paying attention to details on my receipts were evident. He urgently needs retraining. I hope management take the necessary actions on Solomon poor service skills so that this awful experience wont happen again to another customer. If it weren't for my 20 years of membership, I would never return to Costco after this incident.",1715487357,False

My complaint is not about the employees. The staff is pleasant and you can see them working, but management needs to do better.

They don't let you in if you aren't a member, so even if you want to see the prices and items to see if it's worth it to join, you have to go with someone who is a member just to get in the door. They don't take Mastercard, so make sure you have a Visa or cash when you go. If you bring a friend, you'll probably have to pay for them on your same card and split the bill later.
I literally only joined for two specific items that I'd found out they carry like a week before, but because you can't look through the store before you are a member and they don't have guest passes, the day I joined they were out of both things. It was such a schlep to the middle of nowhere just to find out the membership I paid for was pointless.  I tried to order the items through their website and the product information didn't even show up as items they sell, even if they were out of stock, so I thought they were discontinued.
The parking lot at this location in particular is kind of a nightmare because there's basically two lots with a through-lane dividing them and people with their oversized carts just walk willy nilly in front of moving vehicles.
The prices on some of the items are decent enough, but we'll see if my membership actually pays for itself with the five items I get from there.
In comparison, BJ's lets you in even if you're not a member, and you can pay with both Visa and Mastercard. BJ's also has curbside pickup and ordering from their website reflects the products actually available in their store. The Owings Mills and Hunt Valley locations also have only one parking lot so traffic isn't as crazy.
The main difference between BJ's and Costco would be the inventory. Most of it's comparable, but there are things you can only get at one and not the other (which is why I got the Costco one despite them being like nazis about their stores) and sometimes the prices are significantly better at one or the other, but it's a product by product basis.

They treat you like a criminal when checking out.  One lady in particular got an attitude with me while I walked by with and item in a bag that I couldn't return and kept asking for the receipt. I explained to the lady i didn't have a receipt it.was a return i couldn't return and she kept talking over me insisting she needed a receipt instead of listening.

The hassle of not having an exchange policy when a item was on sale.  They tell you they will pull up the coupon at checkout, than the cashiers have another story for you like ""they can't find the coupon""

Requesting id with your membership at self checkout is excessive.

I Was checking out and was unaware the membership expired i wanted to check with my wife before renewing at that moment  and explained that to the cashier.

Absolutely no one knew what I meant when I asked if there was a warranty on the unit. I was told he ""thinks there's a return policy of 90 days"" buy he wasn't sure and I was directed to a manager across the way.

Little did I know I would then have to ask a different manager besides the first, and the second manager told me some of the computers don't even have a return policy- don't forget that I never even asked for that information and my question at this point is still unanswered. There was no sinage or person to tell me there may not be a return policy on the 900 dollar computer I just bought.

Now at this point I'm realizing no one knows what a warranty is. I might be using old retail terminology, but as someone who recently left a position of management even I know that a warranty is the same as a protection plan. So at this point I'm done. The only person who seemed to know what I was talking about walked into the conversation just as I was leaving it. Nice guy, but it was too late. I walked away.

teach your team to ask the right questions, or have the right answers. You know, the answers I later found out were on the receipt. a simple, ""The phone number to call for a protection plan is on the receipt,"" because apparently I can't buy that while I'm in store.

Recently I had a problem with one pair where the screw came out and I dropped them. I went back to Costco to get a repair. When I approached the optical center there were three people standing there with no customers I jokingly said to the person who approached me oh you must have drawn the Short straw. Because I had a problem I said here's the problem and show them to her she looked up the glasses saw that I had purchased them recently and check the ID number on the frame she then told me I can't do anything with this you have to buy a new frame I said but it only needs a screw. She didn't say that would not work and she doesn't know what screw it needs. I asked her if she would just try. She told me you understand this when you buy the glasses there is no warranty. Again repeating it only needs a screw. Why don't you just try she said no I can't do that! I suggested she take the screw out the other side and then she would know what it needed. She said it doesn't work that way. I asked  her again, can't you just try she repeat it know you need to buy new frames. At that point I was pretty upset and I said give me my glasses I'm getting out of here. I went to customer service and spoke to the manager. He explained that they are really not Costco's glasses it's a separate business and there's nothing that he could do about that. He was polite and understood my problem. Just to mention the eyeglass case that they gave me says Kirkland and the cleaning cloth that comes in the case that says Costco. My insurance company said that they have arrangements with Costco for glasses. The person in optical simply did not want to do anything and there was no one else there she had nothing else to do. I got a $1 eyeglass repair kit at the dollar store they gave you an assortment of screws I tried two, the third one fit. I put the lens back in tighten it down and it works perfectly.

Costco's Kirkland brand came out with the BEST frozen gluten-free pizza I've ever had in my life! It's supreme, but thank god they left off the olives. Pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, zucchini, red/orange/yellow peppers. *chefs kiss* thank you costco for continuing to consider those of us with celiac or who can't have gluten. There are a LOT of gluten free options at costco.
--------

Awesome prices & deals on all types of food, books, furniture, electronics, home goods, beauty products etc & even gas. I wish they had diesel.

Check the website to see when specific vendors will be there.

Employees are VERY friendly & try to go above & beyond to help. Hit up the food court on your way out - who can beat a soda & hot dog for $1.50?!

Annual membership is $60 & pays for itself! Shopping in bulk for a family of 5 comes in handy!

Visit between noon & 3 - you can sample all types of foods for free.

I used to love their pepperoni pizza. Unfortunately, I've been diagnosed with celiac disease & can't enjoy it anymore. I wish they offered a gluten free pizza without cross contamination.

Costco has dozens of gluten free options in general. Fresh, refrigerated, frozen, canned, etc, there are many official gluten free certified options. Impressed with the amount of protein shakes in bulk.

Previously, the staff were exceptionally friendly and attentive, with individuals guiding customers to the shortest checkout lines, assisting with loading groceries, offering carry boxes, and greeting with warm smiles. However, this has changed over time, which I understand can happen in many establishments as they mature. With the introduction of self-checkout lines, I found it convenient and didn't need to rely on cashiers as much.

Yet, when employees were assigned to the self-checkout lanes, one would assume they'd be there to assist with scanning items, given their access to barcode scanners. However, this wasn't the case. I encountered a situation where a staff member declined my request for help scanning two king-size pillows, citing them as ""small items,"" despite it likely taking mere seconds. Meanwhile, I observed her colleagues assisting customers with scanning smaller items like boxes of strawberries. It appeared that their willingness to assist depended on their mood, which was disappointing. While I don't mind if they opt not to help if they could let the customers “self”checkout, unfortunately they also tend to linger and monitor the checkout process, seemingly scrutinizing customers until they deem someone “worthy” of their assistance.

*temporary issue*
The concession stand was under construction last time I was there and was closed. It looks like they are going to do a full renovation, but time will tell. I'll update when it reopens if I remember. : )

I don't go there on the weekend if possible. It's incredibly busy and the lines for checkout sometimes reach the back of the store. That said they do do a very good job at getting people through the checkout lanes once you get to the register.

I would definitely avoid this location near the holidays if possible as you will be trapped in the shopping center for a good 10 to 15 minutes at best trying to get back out to the main road. I have been stuck in the traffic for nearly a half hour in the past.

First and foremost, I want to commend Anna L., the cashier who assisted me during checkout. She was exceptionally friendly, helpful, and made my checkout process smooth and pleasant. Her professionalism was truly appreciated.

However, there were some aspects of my visit that left me feeling disappointed. Despite having already scanned my membership card during checkout, I was approached by another staff member who asked to see my membership again. This redundancy felt unnecessary and somewhat frustrating, especially since I had already completed my transaction.

Additionally, I encountered a staff member during the final checkout process who seemed dismissive and unhelpful. When I questioned a procedure, his response was curt and bordered on rude. It would have been more helpful if he had taken the time to explain any new policies rather than dismissing my concerns.

Food court:
Furthermore, while I understand the cashier’s need to count money, a simple acknowledgment of our presence and assurance that she would assist us shortly would have been appreciated.

Lastly, I want to acknowledge the positive interaction I had with William. Despite our frustration and hunger, he remained calm, attentive, and ultimately assisted us with getting our food. His kindness and understanding were a welcome contrast to the challenges we faced earlier in our visit.

In conclusion, while there were highlights during my trip to Costco, such as the excellent service from Anna L. and William’s kindness, there were also moments of frustration and disappointment. I hope this feedback helps Costco improve their customer service and ensure that all customers feel valued and respected throughout their shopping experience.",1713938412,False

I do love Costco Business center cause it’s open to ALL members, no special membership required.

Used to be a secret, no more judging by the amount of cars here.

PRO:
-  Costco on steroids, bigger packs for restaurants or real businesses
- Unique offerings you won’t find in a normal Costco
- Industrial appliances
- Amazing walk in freezer section (bring sweater)
- Bigger meat offering (think bbq or family gathering)
- Food court

CON:
- Always packed
- Truly geared to business so no clothes or food samples or furniture or books
- Hard to get parking (or even a shopping cart at times
- No Gas

SUMMARY:
Although I love Costco business centers, they don’t have it all. Biggest thing is NO gas. So I don’t say you can do it all here",1714755429,False

Their gas station is well organized; even though it's always packed, it doesn't take that long to make your way through. And it's always packed because oftentimes they have the best gas prices in town.

Their eye-glasses department I feel is the best in Chico. They have the absolute lowest prices for frames/lenses versus everywhere else I've experienced. They also have a wide selection of frames for men, which has been an issue for me at other places in the past. Not only that, they took my eye insurance with no problems and I had my new glasses in just 2 weeks.

Then for everything else they sell in the store, they have a nice big variety of items to choose from and their prices are normally lower than other stores. It just depends if you want to buy in bulk or not. Its become one of my family's ""go to"" stores that we visit at least once a month.

Costco also sells a lot of seasonal, non-grocery, related items too and their selection is always changing (the whole middle section of the store). These items always get me into trouble because it's often stuff that I like a lot but they're usually bigger items. So, my wife tries to steer me away from the middle section of the store once she sees me wandering that way, lol.

The last thing I wanted to mention is their food court. You can basically get lunch for pretty darn cheap, and it's usually pretty good. I know some people come here regularly just to visit the food court area.

Every visit to the Cypress, California Costco proves to be a bustling, vibrant experience. Despite the overwhelming rush of customers which is a common spectacle, the staff impresses with their excellent management and efficient handling of the crowd. They perform their duties with a professionalism that truly embodies the spirit of Costco.

Parking can occasionally be a bit of a challenge due to the high traffic volume, but this is a small inconvenience in light of the overall shopping experience. The in-store amenities are numerous, and the pharmacy stands out particularly. The pharmacy technician, Jenn, demonstrates stellar service, embodying an upbeat, positive demeanor that brightens your day. She rectified a price error on one of my medications with such swift grace, it seemed effortless.

The snack bar is also a buzzing hub within the store, constantly busy serving up their delectable treats. A suggestion for improvement would be the incorporation of kiosk ordering at the snack bar, similar to other Costco locations, to streamline the process and better serve the high customer volume.

This Costco location delivers an exceptional shopping experience, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone in the Cypress area. Their staff, especially the likes of Jenn at the pharmacy, and their wide range of products never fail to impress. The busy nature of the store is a testament to its popularity and the value it provides to the community.",1685756632,False

The gas station, known for its competitive prices, sees incredibly long lines. Like many others, I've found that arriving at 7:00 AM significantly cuts down the wait time. Otherwise, the wait can be daunting, and I often find myself looking for other cost-effective fuel options in the area.

Inside, the store maintains the typical Costco standard with a wide variety of products and generally good customer service. However, the food court is a different story. It often has long lines and can run out of supplies, which can be frustrating. The seating area frequently feels overcrowded and could benefit from better management, particularly during busy times.

You know, typically shopping at Costco can be a bit of a hustle, with the packed parking and the post-work crowd, but surprisingly, despite the initial struggle with parking, the rest of my experience was rather positive.

Once inside the store, which by the way, is located in the bustling Bella Terra, I found it to be well-stocked and organized. The particular item that brought me there – an SSD Drive – was available, even though my usual store was out of stock. And this, my friends, is why I love Costco. They always seem to have what you need.

Now, let's talk about the checkout. Despite the very large crowd, I was pleasantly surprised at the efficiency of the process. It was quick, it was easy, and before I knew it, I was out the door. This was a testament to the well-trained and professional staff who handled the constant stream of shoppers like pros.

I must mention though, the long walk back to the car at the front of the mall. It was a bit of a workout but hey, who's complaining about a few extra steps?

In addition, if you ever need to fill up your tank while shopping, the Costco Gasoline in Huntington Beach is worth a visit. There is always a long line here, but moves quickly and huge savings.

In conclusion, my visit to the Costco Wholesale in Huntington Beach was a great experience, and I would recommend it to anyone in need of a good deal on a variety of products. Despite the heavy crowds and the slightly far-off parking, the well-stocked store and the swift checkout process more than made up for it. Happy shopping, everyone!",1688533565,False

They went above and beyond to help us out.
We had a terrible experience while driving south on the Freeway the sunroof of our car suddenly exploded and showered us with glass! Fortunately my adult son, who was driving, kept his cool and calmly took the nearest exit which happened to be near the Costco.
After parking, I asked the staff in the tire shop to help us- they advised us to go Mr Car Wash and vacuum the glass- the awesome free vacuum was amazingly efficient.
We went back to Costco to wait for AAA to tow us. It began to rain and we had no roof!
We again asked for help and the tire shop moved our car inside for shelter.
I went inside Costco, we are members, we looked for tarps but the only ones for sale are heavy duty stiff plastic ones that would ruin the car paintwork.
Then I noticed that the mattresses have heavy duty giant plastic bags. But they are not for sale. I spoke to a couple of staff members and they kindly gave me a bag.
Their kindness allowed me to cover the roof of my car- by tucking the bag into the doors and the corners under the edge of the hood next to the windshield.
The tow truck arrived soon after. We reached our home safely and despite the pouring rain the whole way home, our car interior stayed dry.
Thank you so much for your kindness Costco Staff Manteca.",1705878044,False

One tire had already gone completely flat as the entire side wall had failed (first picture). BF Goodrich has had problems with sidewall failures, and will reimburse customers for the remaining tread toward the purchase of new tires.  Costco also has a similar policy, and I had purchased these tires 3 years ago from Costco.
I told the employees and managers that all I wanted was the warranty benefits of credit toward the unused tread for the purchase of a new set of tires, since I still had about 10,000 miles left on the tread.
The employees and ""managers"" there claimed these off-road tires will fail if I take my truck offroading (which I haven't) and if Armor All ""protectant"" is placed on them.  Funny I didn't see that on any of the warranty information with Costco or BF Goodrich.  The ""manager"" said the ""best"" he could do is give me $30 off a new set off tires, but would not honor either warranty.
We have been going to Costco for tires for many years, but this is the final straw.  When they crushed the lug nuts on my truck and made me buy new ones, (which are a custom order from Toyota), I was hesitant to come back here.  But after making us stand in the rain while they sat inside trying to decide how to get out of their warranty, I am done.

How can this store allow the cashiers to be so entitled to exhibit rudeness!

As this cashier behavior is wrong and violates  operating protocols, i stood up to this thug and said “no, your wrong , providing a receipt from the printer is your assigned job not mine, as i’ve had discussions with your senior leadership about this”

Carlos then replied with a thug tone “your wrong” then finally provided the receipt.

I’m fascinated this store is hiring thugs , while the cashier supervisors have zero knowledge about holding cashiers accountable to a minimum standard of behaviors.

CON:
- No gas.  No gas. NO GAS STATION
- Very busy mall
- Difficult to find parking

SUMMARY:
Much to like about this Costco.  But the lack of gas here means you either go towards SF or towards Rohnert - not ideal if you are on the go.

You can get unique selections due to the area.  The wine is the best I've seen at any Costco.  I found special ice wine from Canada, that's amazing.  The selection of the California wines here is amazing due to the proximity to Sonoma & Napa.",1706421499,False

Yesterday we bought two citrus trees at $19.00 each, indicating fast sale.  At cashier, it was $26.99 each.  We caught the mistake, and it was corrected after some maneuvering.  Imagine if customer is not vigilant. Then we noticed sales tax was added on the fruit trees, which shouldn't based on our experience.  I then talked to two managers at least that are what they claimed, named Ramone and Sherrie, who said that is Costco policy of adding sales tax on fruit trees based on California law.  I showed them California Board of Equalization Regulations 1588 regarding seeds, plants and fertilizers, which clearly states no sales tax on fruit trees. Then they said Costco policy supercedes whatever.  They said if you don't like this Costco policy, then don't buy it.  These two self-claimed managers continued to escalate their hostilities.  If these are the people working for Costco, and Costco continues thinking that they are too popular and too big to fail, it will be like Sears and the likes.  I also simulated buying an apple tree from Amazon, and it showed no sales tax applied.  Imagine how many loyal customers have been ripped off by Costco.  I also remember many years back when Costco was selling discounted items but sales tax based on the original price.

After writing the above, I reviewed the receipt carefully and I see the problem as follows: when scanned at $26.99, the item is called Citrus Tree and there is no ""A"" after $26.99, indicating no sales tax.  When the same item was re-scanned at $19.00, another so-called manager called the item 27 GARDEN, then an ""A"" appears, indicating sales tax.  The problems of bad customer services are still there as follows:
1.  These two clown idiotic so-called managers, RAMONE and SHERRIE, as well as other employees kept insisting it is Costco policy to add sales tax to fruit trees.  They even called me tax cheater.
2.  Bad attitudes, such as ""if you don't like this Costco policy, don't buy it"", ""you can always hire your attorney to challenge Costco"", and on and on.

A big rib bone popping out of a Dinosaur sized Steak, not only that but big Beef Brisket and giant Pork Butt~ Great Rubs and More.

One tip is the Pesto in a jar, it is unreal, loaded with cheese and Basil olive oil, it compliments a Sandwich or with Pasta~ it is exquisite.

Then, good luck finding a parking spot. The parking lot is chaos, and I can't imagine how many accidents must occur. The line for gas, despite recently changing, still often leads out to the street, blocking traffic.

Inside the club you're met with extraordinarily long lines to check out, even in self-check out.

The food court, despite making changes to their check-out experience, also seems to always have wildly long lines and waits.

With as well as this store must do, it's a shame they haven't considered moving locations to provide a better experience to their customers. Expand their parking lot to double, and consider building out the store to support more customer visits.

This one star is  on a product I bought.

I am writing to express my disappointment regarding the quality of the produce I recently purchased at your location.
On Sunday, April 14th, I purchased a box of Rio King green seedless table grapes from the store. While they appeared fresh in the box, upon tasting them, I found them to be very old and lacking in flavor. This is not the first time I've encountered such issues with the produce at Costco Sand City. Last week, I also purchased green beans that were not only old but also moldy. I feel embarrassed to take them back and return them.
As a loyal Costco member, I have always trusted the quality of your products. However, these recent experiences have left me concerned about the standards of your produce selection at the Sand City location. I believe that as a reputable retailer, it is essential to maintain high-quality standards to uphold customer satisfaction.

Loved the greenhouse going for $1,349.99 even though it's made with plastic instead of glass windows.

I love Costco, who doesn't, but this obsessive moving items around for the shopper to ""meander around and stumble upon new treasures"" is annoying, irritating and well underhanded. It's obvious why it is done.

In Costco mission statement it states: taking care of members and employees. How does moving stuff around every day fit in the statement. The employees themselves don't know where items are most likely because swing shift probably doesn't let day shift know. Then again maybe that's intentional?

Suggestions: have the one shift alert the other of the major item movement during morning meetings, so they a least have an inkling of were products are so when a member asks they sort of know the general location. Two move things around less often and three if you insist on moving things around put like things in like places. Example nuts with nuts not in some random place. Yes I experienced that. Walnuts were in a completely different location then the others.

If you really want to ""take care of membership and employees"" stop moving things around every single day. Yes, I have walked out of the store twice because I was so frustrated and went elsewhere. Why because its annoying.

Members and employees don't need items moved around for ""our"" benefit to find a new deal. It only benefits Costco, which I get you have the right to do what ever you like, but really every single day and twisting that around so its beneficial for the member...It's about filling up the cart and not convenience (which  I guess you might agree with that).

PS this may seem petty to some and maybe it is in the overall scheme things but it's very annoying and not about convenience. People love Costco, if they want something they will seek it out. There is no need to make that more complicated in the name of finding treasures.

Thanks for letting me vent.

However, a recent encounter with a particularly rude manager left me questioning the brand's commitment to customer satisfaction.

Despite my initial excitement over finding a dresser I liked, marked down from $899 to $699, my enthusiasm quickly waned due to the poor treatment I received at checkout. While the helpfulness of employees like, I think his name was Felipe, who went above and beyond to assist me, was commendable, it was overshadowed by the unprofessional conduct of certain staff members.

During checkout, I was appalled to overhear the cashier and bagger openly criticizing the value of the dress I was purchasing. Their disparaging remarks uttered in full earshot, reflected poorly on the store's commitment to customer satisfaction and respect.

The real disappointment, however, came when I encountered the manager. Not only did she exhibit a dismissive and condescending attitude towards both myself and Employee Brian (Loader), who was trying his best to accommodate my needs, but she also seemed entirely disinterested in resolving the situation amicably. Her disregard for my concerns and blatant lack of professionalism left a lasting impression.

Despite the challenges I faced, the helpfulness and kindness of Brian, Felipe, the lady who checks receipts, and the four gentlemen who actually loaded the item into my truck, ultimately salvaged the situation. Their willingness to assist me in finding a solution and accommodating my needs stood in stark contrast to the behavior exhibited by the manager and the cashiers.

While I understand that every business may encounter its fair share of challenges, I hope this feedback serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining a standard of excellence in customer service. If Costco truly values its customers, it must address rudeness and unprofessionalism among its staff, particularly those in managerial positions.

As a side note, I am extremely happy with the dresser and its worth every penny and hassle I went through to get it home.",1707265406,False

Disrespectful and Threatening Behavior!!!

I had the unfortunate experience of encountering a pharmacist named Nas? Nos? Something like that. Whatever, doesn't really matter since all the pharmacists seem terrible at this point. I've been thinking about this for a few days now, and I have to air my grievances and warn others, because this last visit to the pharmacy, it was one of the most unpleasant encounters I've had in a long time. From the moment I stepped up to the counter, the pharmacist made it clear that she had little regard for professionalism. First and foremost, she talked down to me in a manner that was not only disrespectful but also very embarrassing! She made me feel as if my concerns over MY MEDICATION didn't matter and that I was wasting her time.

As if her treatment of me wasn't bad enough, her behavior toward her colleagues was equally appalling. I witnessed her yelling at another employee in full view of me and other customers in the middle of our conversation! Her lack of professionalism was not only embarrassing but also deeply concerning, as it raised serious questions about the work culture and ethics of the pharmacy as a whole.

This isn't the first time I've had issues with the pharmacists at this Costco, but despite my attempts to address the issues with the store manager, I think his name is Robert, nothing has been done. I feel so bad for the employees who have to work here...

I don't feel safe having my prescriptions filled here anymore. I've already begun transferring them out and I highly recommend that others do the same! These people in the white coats are completely incompetent! At least the employees in blue try to help... People these days are just horrendous.",1714441719,False

""I recently visited the Costco location in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and I must say, it left quite an impression. Unlike our Costco back in Southlake, TX, this warehouse was bustling with shoppers, and it's easy to see why. The abundance of inventory was remarkable, and it seemed like they had everything, including a variety of products on clearance.

One aspect that stood out to me was the thoughtful approach to sustainability. The presence of trash cans specifically designated for landfill and recycling was a positive surprise. It's a small but impactful step towards reducing environmental impact, and it's great to see a big retailer taking such measures.

The spacious layout of the warehouse, similar to other Costco locations, made shopping a breeze, and the large parking lot provided convenience. My husband and I also enjoyed exploring products that we don't usually find in our local Costco. It's clear that this location caters to a diverse range of preferences.

Additionally, the expansive food court was a pleasant surprise. It offered a variety of options for a quick bite after a shopping spree. The overall experience at Costco Ann Arbor, Michigan, was delightful, and the combination of a vast inventory, eco-friendly practices, and convenient facilities makes it a standout location in our book.

Unfortunately, my recent encounter with one of your managers left me with a negative impression.

On 11/21/2023, I visited the Costco Havana to return a few purchases. I approached the customer service desk and was waiting for 15-20 minutes. Basel, who claimed himself a manager for 7 years but didn't know to do customer service. He spent so much time chatting in his language with a folk to do 1 return of a shirt. The line was getting longer as he kept chatting which was not professional at all. Then it came my turn, I wanted to return 4 shirts because the price went different. No asking or anything, he just used a higher price to do the return. For a self-claim manager for 7 years, he didn't know why people want to do a return and insisted me to do a return in a higher price. Why would someone do a return in a higher price, let's ask yourself that question, Basel!
More disrespectfully as he went, he proceeded to put words in my mouth by saying loudly I didn't respect him and what not. I simply told him, ""If you can't do it, just cancel the return"". Basel went on with his stupid accusation and didn't want to listen to my explanation, he gave no care how a long line was waiting for his 7-year profession and how loud he was. I was infuriated as he kept putting words in my mouth and did not let me speak, I eventually said louder that if he couldn't do it, stopped it and cancelled it.

Basel displayed a lack of patience and courtesy. Instead of addressing my concerns with empathy and understanding, he exhibited dismissive and condescending behavior. As a member who values the customer service standards set by Costco, this experience was highly disheartening.

ALL OTHER employees, they are extremely helpful and thoughtful whenever I did any return. I don't care if they are non-manager level, their experience and service always met the expectation and wonderful. I understand that everyone has bad days, but I believe it is crucial for managers, especially in customer-facing roles, to maintain a level of professionalism and courtesy at all times. Especially when you call yourself ""I'm a 7-year manager"", think 7 times before you speak!",1708378929,False

I recently visited the Costco Business Center on Zuni St. in Denver, Colorado, and I must say, it surpassed my expectations. Having previously been to the Dallas location, the size difference was immediately noticeable. The walk-in refrigerated room is a colossal space, possibly around 20,000 sq ft, providing an extensive range of products.

One aspect that stood out was the impeccable organization and cleanliness throughout the facility. Unlike the chaos often found in other wholesale stores, this Costco Business Center maintains a neat and tidy environment. The commercial appliances section was a delight, offering a diverse range of products catering to various businesses.

Similar to regular Costco locations, the parking lot is spacious, making the shopping experience convenient. It's worth noting that, like other business centers, there are no samples or gas stations. This, however, doesn't take away from the overall positive experience.

In summary, if you're looking for a Costco Business Center that goes above and beyond, the Zuni St. location in Denver is a must-visit. The vast refrigerated room, organized layout, and extensive commercial appliance selection make it a standout choice for business and bulk shopping.",1701964279,False

My suggestion is to take pictures in front of mirror of glasses you're trying on, then picture of frame with item number, and repeat it for all the frames you like. It makes it easier to narrow down.

The store is fairly new and seems clean and well stocked. For the most part was having a great experience from the greeter to the person that eloped me out with the membership.

I strolled around and initially seemed the main  issue were the customers.  Which I'm not putting on the store. I immediately seemed apparent customers are not too courteous navigating the aisles. Individuals that seem to be in a rush while getting flustered moving their carts in the left side of wrong direction. Even in stores believe should keep a sense of direction to avoid bumping to others around corners. That alone was just the first impression besides the ""high MakaMaka""  demeanor most customers and some staff exhibited. I would like to believe they're not locals but I'm afraid they're for the most part the very individuals complain about other chains customers. To top it off carts are just left wherever as nobody sees to bother putting them back. People just standing blocking narrow aisles with no concern for others.

Anyways on to the actual staff and store gripes.

1. The cashier didnt seem too friendly.
2. The cashier in food court more obviously rude with an attitude she was annoyed to take order and bit rude asking which method of payment as if I had an idea there were kiosks which I didn't notice until after. Mandi could use some training in customer service.

coming to Costco, as I get ready to come to check out - I start to feel anxious and uneasy. Every. Single. Time. Why?

Last time it was for splitting our transaction (with the same bank card might I add) one for food for a party and one for food for our home - as we try to keep track of our budget. This time? For having two carts. We’re a family of 6, we buy a lot of stuff. Isn’t that the point of Costco?

Unfortunately, the nearest Costco is it a bit of a drive from my home compared to our local Sam's Club. So my review today will take the consideration the competition.
Let me start by saying I love Costco! Their products are quality, their stores are usually pretty clean (considering how many people shop there), and the employees are very friendly and helpful.  Unlike Sam's Club, they are almost always fully staffed.

What I am about to write might be the only thing I don't like about Costco, so here it goes.

I understand how retail stores are trying to save money with the self checkout lines. Costco's is an utter disaster.  The fact that you have to take your heavy, bulk, items out of your cart, scan them, then put them on the scale, then put them back in your cart is unacceptable. It's faster just to go have One of the friendly workers do it for you the old fashioned way.  But you might say, ""but they usually have a worker that can come and scan your heavy items for you!"" If this is the case, then what is the purpose of the self checkout line in the first place?  On top of that, there is usually one worker for every six self-checkout lines and they are almost always trying to help somebody else so it's a complete waste of time.  I do everything in my power to avoid using the self-check outlines at Costco.

If you've never shopped at Sam's Club, let me tell you about that experience. You have two options.

The first option is that you can go to the self checkout line, take the scanning gun that is available at each line, scan your items while they are in your cart, pay, have your receipt checked, then leave the store.

The second option is called Scan and Go. With this option you use an app on your phone to pay for all of your items as you shop, you then pay for everything from your phone, have one of the checkout people scan your electronic receipt to make sure you aren't stealing anything, and leave the store.  It is quick, seamless, and works extremely well. I rarely see long lines at Sam's Club.

Costco, please address this.  You are better than this.  Thanks.",1711286732,False

We noticed many unique products and surprised over how different it is from more traditional stores. The variety and volume of products in meat, cheese, paper products, and snacks, is beyond what we expected. That said, we were very disappointed with the quality of the fresh fruit we purchased.

Two packages of Red grapes were both far beyond what should have been available for sale. When we arrived home we quickly discovered they were incredibly over-ripe, soft, and nearly mush.  Plan to call the store back, but ours were just two from the many pallets of same which were on display for sale. I’m sure there are, and will be many more dissatisfied customers. This is preventable.

** Following up on this post. I tried calling the store numerous times after sharing this feedback. Eventually I gave up having not connected with anyone. Voice message was not returned either. This is absolutely not what we have become accustomed to as Costco customers. In fact, we have always appreciated their focus on customer service, and quality products.

My recent experience at this particular Costco, however, surpassed all expectations.
We arrived a little late, and by the time we reached the checkout, it was already 9 PM - a full half an hour after the store's usual closing time. Despite this, we were not rushed or hurried, but rather met with an unruffled and patient attitude from the staff.
Following our checkout, we decided to get some food, and what was truly astonishing was the grace with which the staff handled this. They graciously permitted us to dine in, allowing us to enjoy our meal at a relaxed pace, despite the fact that it was significantly past their scheduled closing time. There was a complete absence of impatience or frustration from the staff members. Instead, we were treated with understanding, kindness, and a warm smile, which significantly added to our enjoyment of the evening.
This extraordinary experience is a testament to Costco's dedication to customer satisfaction. It wasn't just about staying open late or letting us eat in peace; it was the genuine kindness and patience exhibited by the staff that left a deep impression.
On top of this excellent service, the store also boasts some fantastic deals. The wide range of products and their unbeatable prices is another factor that contributes to the unique shopping experience at Costco. It's not just the savings on offer, but the quality of the products available that make shopping here such a pleasure.

I brought my truck in for tire replacement on 2/24/2023 at 9:30 AM at the Costco in Spartanburg, SC.

I told them that I have never had an issue with any sensor and they worked perfectly fine before they serviced them as part of the tire installation package. Sure enough, about 15 miles after leaving the store a warning light came on and the vehicle could no longer read pressure on three of the tires. Could one go bad in the three hours they had my vehicle? Highly unlikely, but possible. Could 3? That would be impossible.

In trying to deal with the shop, they were really snarky and questioned that they were working, sarcastically saying ""this is my question to you since you are my expert, another learning moment for me.""  I would not expect such an unprovoked lack of respect and professionalism from anyone in any sort of leadership capacity.

As for the tires, I ended up purchasing a reprogramming tool on Amazon at my expense to reprogram the sensors as the shop should have done in the first place.  Surprise, surprise, my supposedly broken sensors now work just fine.

Honestly wound up buying stuff we never would have thought of just because we were able to taste it. Also we sampled stuff that we didn't like that we were going to buy so I think that is very good I wish other superstores like this did that more often.

Recently, the place has become impossible, defective, and infuriating. They don’t have enough opticians working to accommodate the number of customers. You have to take a number and wait. They move at a snail’s pace, and seem to be looking for anything else to do instead of helping the people waiting. I dropped off a pair of glasses on March 1 to have new lenses put in. They told me a week and a half, and they’d call.  In the past, this usually meant a week, and I’d get a text. After a week, I was there shopping, and just thought I’d check to see. They wouldn’t even look at me without a number, and there were eight people waiting, so I left. Yesterday, I tried calling, but they weren’t picking up the phone. I called the service desk and the woman actually offered to walk over to see if my glasses were in. Indeed, they were just sitting there! She told me there was eight people in line there and only two opticians and recommended I come later. I decided to be the first one there this morning, and was waiting outside at 9:40. Other people were already there. When that door opened, I literally ran to the optical shop, and there was another woman who ran in through the exit to do the same thing. I beat her to the punch, and got the first number. We sat down in the only two chairs there to wait, as there was no optician there yet. We commiserated, and she had essentially the same story as me, having gone in one day last week at 10:15, only to find eight people ahead of her, and a wait of an hour and a half. She picked up new glasses that had a problem and had to be returned. Well, today when the optician finally arrived, he began puttering around the counter, but avoided dealing with the customers at all costs. Finally, he waved me up. Right out of the box, he commented, “well, there’s a problem right there.” It turned out that they only put the correct coatings on one lens, but no coatings on the other. The glasses needed to be sent back to the lab. I explained my saga to him and that I’m a pilot who needs correct glasses to fly in the morning. He told me he could offer me express shipping to and from the lab on the West Coast, and that’s great, but it doesn’t help me for tomorrow morning when I have to fly. It also means that I will lose at least another couple of hours to accomplish the simple task of having updated lenses installed in my glasses. Fast forward: when the glasses came back the second time, they had NO COATING ON EITHER LENS! They had to be sent back to the West Coast a third time. I was told they would be expedited. I still don’t have them. As of last night (MAY 2nd!), the manager told me, “your frames are at the lab. I called and encouraged them to make your lenses.” I began this process when I was still wearing a winter coat. Now I’m wearing shorts and a T-shirt, and I still don’t have my eyeglasses! With this, I have decided that the better prices at the Costco optical center don’t end up saving me anything. With all of the wasted time and trips, and all of the unnecessary aggravation, it’s the same as paying double at LensCrafters. It’s too bad, really. He told me he’s the manager of the optical center and he tells the general manager they need more opticians behind the counter, but that it falls on deaf ears. He asked me to express my frustration in writing to the general manager. I’m using this platform to do just that. I hope they may read this and fix their broken optical center. In the meantime, I may just dispute the charge with my credit card company.",1714733925,False

It's well worth the membership cost for most things, if you have space to buy in bulk or you have a large family and go through things quickly or need to buy in large quantities. They do sell other items in smaller quantities, clothes, and some fresh foods that benefit anyone. The stock changes up frequently always giving something new to try, while the core items you rely on are usually always available. There are also some great deals on things if you keep an eye out for them.
The only thing I'm not a fan of is the constant attention from the employees treating everyone like they are a thief. You have to show your card upon entering the store, before you can check out your products, and your cart is inspected against the receipt on the way out. I understand wanting to reduce shrinkage and membership sharing, but to be frank, that's not my problem as someone who both has a membership and shops with honesty. It reduces the customer experience to be scrutinized when you have not and will not do anything wrong. This is clearly not something that only bothers me, but yet it continues regardless. Maybe if the check happened only once at the register it would be less frustrating and more understandable since it is impossible to check out without a card, even if you walk in the store without one.

I’ve been a loyal shopper, fan of Costco and a ‘Gold Star Executive member’ for years.

I’m single, shop for me only, but thought one day, “I’ve never even received one penny kick back for the executive membership. Why have it? Maybe I just don’t spend enough”

Turns out I’ve been throwing money away for years.

Anyone want to guess where your Executive rewards voucher comes? In your renewal mailer.
A renewal mailer that has ZERO outward markings on the envelope indicating your rewards voucher is inside. Literally zero.

Costco ‘conveniently’ offers membership renewal at the pump, I do it. Guess where the renewal mailer goes? Trash.
Costco ‘conveniently’ offers membership renewal at checkout. I do it. Guess where the renewal mailer goes? Trash.

No reminder at checkout renewal about my rewards.  No email about rewards. No mailer with any outward markings about my rewards. Nothing.
I can only imagine the 10’s of millions of dollars Costco doesn’t pay out simply because of this clearly planned deceitful strategy.

After talking to a friend about it, I opened my last renewal mailer. I had already renewed at the pump but, lo and behold, a $148 voucher was inside.

While it might be hard to outwardly claim this is a scam, this is certainly corporate deception at its finest, and I thought more of Costco as a business.

Mostly, I purchase the gas because top tier. And the price is always much lower than gas at convenient stores. And unlike Sam’s there are plenty of pumps and even if crowded the wait isn’t long. There is also plenty of parking at the store. No such thing as driving around to find a parking space like you tend to at Sam’s.

The deli is very clean and they also have an ATM machine next to it. While waiting on hot dog the lady made ice cream sundaes for a customer and they looked delicious! I think I may go back today and get one; strawberry!! 😃

And they have beautiful Christmas decorations at a very reasonable price. I actually love this store because always so very organized and neat!! I’m OCD 😉

The incident that prompted this review occurred on the 8th of this month at approximately 1:20 pm. A light greenish-blue Volvo, driven by one of their employees, recklessly entered the parking lot as if rushing to make it to their shift on time. The driver's aggressive maneuvering nearly resulted in a collision with our vehicle. Despite our attempts to alert him with a honk, he responded with a rude gesture using his middle finger before hastily parking.

Furthermore, the recent policies implemented by the store have added unnecessary inconvenience to the shopping experience. Since October, customers are not only required to present identification upon entry but are also asked to produce the same card again during checkout. This redundant procedure, coupled with the mandatory inspection of receipts upon departure, fosters an environment that feels distrustful and unwelcoming. No customer should feel like a criminal simply for patronizing a store.

While I understand the importance of security measures, the implementation here feels excessive and disrespectful to loyal customers. Personally, I find the shopping experience at other establishments, such as Sam's, to be far more accommodating and respectful of customer privacy. Unless there are significant improvements in both customer service and policies, I regret to say that I will be taking my business elsewhere.",1708019704,False

I have yet to have a good experience at the tire center here. I have two main issues:
1. I easily spend twice or more time here than anywhere else for similar service
2. They did not own up to $385 of damage they caused to my car

More details:
1. The most common problem I've had is how much time I waste even though I always have an appointment. (The difficulty of getting one is another matter) Dropping off? Wait 20 minutes in line. Picking up? Wait 20 minutes...  (or longer) Maybe I'm just plagued with always picking a bad time to go in, but seems unlikely, especially when I always have an appointment.  Work times are also considerably longer than other places I've done business with. My best case scenario when I've gotten a tire fixed was about an hour and a half. I've also waited almost 3 hours before.

2. They did not own up to their negligence and the damage they caused to my car. I had tires installed at this Costco on an Odyssey with 200k miles. When I got my tires rotated the first time, one of the lug nuts was stripped on a wheel stud and broke off. Any mechanic will tell you this is the fault of the person who last put the lug nuts on: they didn't take the time to thread it by hand initially and just forced it on with an impact wrench. Obvious negligence on Costco's part. I had to fill out a form about the damage (after waiting in line 20+ min...), then deal with a 3rd party with lots of back and forth conversations. They denied the claim because their excuse was they said wheel studs are supposed to be replaced at 100k miles as part of normal maintenance! That isn't in the manual and several mechanics I spoke to had never heard of that (including the Frisco Honda dealership). Costco's representative wouldn't budge. When I asked for documentation to prove what they were telling me, they blew me off. The only thing I can think of where they are getting the 100k mile number is that is when the wheel studs are out of warranty. By that logic, if they crashed my car into the wall they wouldn't pay for that either since the entire car is out of warranty. I had to get the wheel stud replaced for $385 - one of the cheapest quotes I found. Assuming it is negligible to replace the other studs on the same wheel, according to Costco, you are supposed to spend $1600 to have all your wheel studs replaced at 100k miles. Absurd I had to pay for Costco's negligence.

I'll never give Costco my tire business again, even for work that might entail using the warranty and should be ""free"".",1713111904,False

The first thing that struck me was the incredible variety of products available. From groceries to electronics, furniture to clothing, Costco seems to have it all. Whether you're shopping for your household or business needs, you're likely to find what you're looking for.

Costco's membership model may deter some, but I found it to be well worth it. The savings from bulk buying can be substantial. While individual item prices might seem a bit higher, the overall value for larger quantities is excellent. I've found that the annual membership fee more than pays for itself through the savings I've accrued.

The quality of products at Costco is generally top-notch. They carry reputable brands, and their Kirkland Signature private label often offers a more affordable option without compromising on quality.

One highlight of my visit was the food court. Costco's food offerings are both delicious and budget-friendly. The famous hot dogs and pizza slices are well worth the visit alone.

Customer service at Costco is impressive. The return policy is generous, and the staff members are consistently helpful and friendly. It's a welcoming environment that adds to the overall positive shopping experience.

While the stores can get crowded, especially on weekends, it's a testament to Costco's popularity. However, I appreciate that they've made strides in improving their online shopping experience for those who prefer to shop from home.

I also commend Costco for its sustainability efforts, including commitments to sourcing sustainable products and reducing its environmental impact. It's reassuring to see a big retailer taking steps toward a more eco-friendly future.

In conclusion, Costco offers a comprehensive shopping experience with its wide product selection, membership benefits, and excellent savings on bulk items. The quality of products and customer service is commendable, and the food court is a delightful bonus. While the membership fee and crowds may not be for everyone, I find that the benefits far outweigh any drawbacks. Costco continues to be a top choice for my shopping needs.",1694989116,False

Admin informed me that my best option was to come into the store, select and pay for tires, and finally to make an appointment for installation.   Basically two trips. Admin then said I could leave a message and the tire section would call me back, I could order the tires, schedule an installation appointment and be done.

I'm still waiting on them to call me back after 5 days.   In the meantime I called Discount Tire, had them ordered and installed three days ago.   And...  Discount Tire was even cheaper by a few dollars.

Compared to the prices of a deli at a grocery store, you can save from 50% to 70% off per pound.  The savings vary depending upon what retail price you compare with the same kind of wholesalers deli product.

I have yet to have a good experience at the tire center here. I have two main issues:
1. I easily spend twice or more time here than anywhere else for similar service
2. They did not own up to $385 of damage they caused to my car

More details:
1. The most common problem I've had is how much time I waste even though I always have an appointment. (The difficulty of getting one is another matter) Dropping off? Wait 20 minutes in line. Picking up? Wait 20 minutes...  (or longer) Maybe I'm just plagued with always picking a bad time to go in, but seems unlikely, especially when I always have an appointment.  Work times are also considerably longer than other places I've done business with. My best case scenario when I've gotten a tire fixed was about an hour and a half. I've also waited almost 3 hours before.

2. They did not own up to their negligence and the damage they caused to my car. I had tires installed at this Costco on an Odyssey with 200k miles. When I got my tires rotated the first time, one of the lug nuts was stripped on a wheel stud and broke off. Any mechanic will tell you this is the fault of the person who last put the lug nuts on: they didn't take the time to thread it by hand initially and just forced it on with an impact wrench. Obvious negligence on Costco's part. I had to fill out a form about the damage (after waiting in line 20+ min...), then deal with a 3rd party with lots of back and forth conversations. They denied the claim because their excuse was they said wheel studs are supposed to be replaced at 100k miles as part of normal maintenance! That isn't in the manual and several mechanics I spoke to had never heard of that (including the Frisco Honda dealership). Costco's representative wouldn't budge. When I asked for documentation to prove what they were telling me, they blew me off. The only thing I can think of where they are getting the 100k mile number is that is when the wheel studs are out of warranty. By that logic, if they crashed my car into the wall they wouldn't pay for that either since the entire car is out of warranty. I had to get the wheel stud replaced for $385 - one of the cheapest quotes I found. Assuming it is negligible to replace the other studs on the same wheel, according to Costco, you are supposed to spend $1600 to have all your wheel studs replaced at 100k miles. Absurd I had to pay for Costco's negligence.

I'll never give Costco my tire business again, even for work that might entail using the warranty and should be ""free"".",1713111904,False

The first thing that struck me was the incredible variety of products available. From groceries to electronics, furniture to clothing, Costco seems to have it all. Whether you're shopping for your household or business needs, you're likely to find what you're looking for.

Costco's membership model may deter some, but I found it to be well worth it. The savings from bulk buying can be substantial. While individual item prices might seem a bit higher, the overall value for larger quantities is excellent. I've found that the annual membership fee more than pays for itself through the savings I've accrued.

The quality of products at Costco is generally top-notch. They carry reputable brands, and their Kirkland Signature private label often offers a more affordable option without compromising on quality.

One highlight of my visit was the food court. Costco's food offerings are both delicious and budget-friendly. The famous hot dogs and pizza slices are well worth the visit alone.

Customer service at Costco is impressive. The return policy is generous, and the staff members are consistently helpful and friendly. It's a welcoming environment that adds to the overall positive shopping experience.

While the stores can get crowded, especially on weekends, it's a testament to Costco's popularity. However, I appreciate that they've made strides in improving their online shopping experience for those who prefer to shop from home.

I also commend Costco for its sustainability efforts, including commitments to sourcing sustainable products and reducing its environmental impact. It's reassuring to see a big retailer taking steps toward a more eco-friendly future.

In conclusion, Costco offers a comprehensive shopping experience with its wide product selection, membership benefits, and excellent savings on bulk items. The quality of products and customer service is commendable, and the food court is a delightful bonus. While the membership fee and crowds may not be for everyone, I find that the benefits far outweigh any drawbacks. Costco continues to be a top choice for my shopping needs.",1694989116,False

I was in the market for tires.  I still had some tread remaining but was going on a road trip and thought I should have them replaced.

I called the store and worked through the phone system to reach the tire section.   After a couple of days of ringing them  several times each day I selected the option to talk with Admin.

Admin informed me that my best option was to come into the store, select and pay for tires, and finally to make an appointment for installation.   Basically two trips. Admin then said I could leave a message and the tire section would call me back, I could order the tires, schedule an installation appointment and be done.

I'm still waiting on them to call me back after 5 days.   In the meantime I called Discount Tire, had them ordered and installed three days ago.   And...  Discount Tire was even cheaper by a few dollars.

As a longtime Costco member, I've always appreciated the warehouse club's commitment to providing value and convenience to its customers. However, their recent changes to the self-checkout process have left me utterly disappointed and questioning their priorities.

The new self-checkout system is an absolute nightmare for shoppers. Instead of streamlining the checkout process, Costco has made it an unnecessarily arduous and time-consuming ordeal. Customers are now forced to remove every single item from their cart, scan them one by one, place them in a designated weight area, and then painstakingly reload their cart. It's a ridiculous and counterintuitive process that defeats the purpose of self-checkout entirely.

If Costco's primary concern is theft prevention, they should address it through alternative means rather than inconveniencing and frustrating their loyal customer base. We, as paying members, should not be burdened with such an inefficient and cumbersome checkout process.

Costco has two reasonable options to rectify this situation:

Offer a discount or incentive to customers who endure the self-checkout ordeal. If they insist on making our lives more difficult, the least they could do is provide some form of compensation for our patience and cooperation.

Hire more employees to assist with the checkout process. This would alleviate the need for the overly complicated self-checkout system and provide a more efficient and pleasant shopping experience for everyone involved.

Costco prides itself on being a customer-centric company, but these recent changes to the self-checkout process contradict that very principle. It's time for the warehouse giant to reevaluate their priorities and consider the convenience and satisfaction of their loyal members. Failure to address this issue promptly may drive customers away and tarnish Costco's reputation as a shopper-friendly establishment.",1713044164,False

I would not buy anything with a rebate at the check stand because if you're not quick to notice they will overcharge you if they forgot to take the sign down.,1713552229,False

Staff is always really helpful and quick to get through the checkout lines. Everyone seems really happy and hard-working and it's definitely a blessing that the families in Kyle get to take home these deals now!

Updated review...
I was recently in here around noon on a weekday and there was only one person working the cash register..... And there were several people working the self checkout line.

Unfortunately the person working the main check out was a little bit slow and line was really backed up. It probably took 20 minutes to get through the line which seems really odd because there's a manager trying to get people that had tons of stuff to go to the to the self-checkout. They're all so many people working there so I don't understand why they would let a line back up so far 😭😭😭",1687283856,False

As someone who grew up in the Philippines, discovering Costco in Lewisville, TX felt like finding a piece of heaven. This location stands out with its diverse array of Asian products, a delightful surprise not found in other Costco branches like Southlake, TX. The food court's double chocolate chunk cookies were a sweet revelation, absent in my usual Costco haunt.

However, my recent visit on a Sunday around 2 pm left a bittersweet taste. While I've never encountered a rude Costco employee anywhere else, this particular visit had its challenges. The checkout process was chaotic, whether opting for self-checkout or the regular lanes. The long lines seemed exacerbated by a thorough, time-consuming examination of purchases, especially at the regular checkouts. Perhaps it was a long day for the employee in question, but the extended wait after a tiring shopping spree was less than ideal.

Despite the minor hiccup, my love for Costco remains intact, and I'll continue exploring new locations – just maybe not this one on a Sunday afternoon. The Lewisville branch holds its unique charm, but efficiency at the checkout could use a boost to make the experience truly heavenly.",1705870182,False

I'm compelled to share a recent disappointing experience at Costco, which has left me reconsidering my membership. After completing our shopping and proceeding through checkout, my elderly mother and I were heading towards the exit when we were stopped for a routine receipt check—an expected procedure at Costco. To our surprise, the employee discovered that a box of bleach bottles had been inadvertently left unscanned, sitting unnoticed at the bottom of our cart. It was clear that this oversight happened during the checkout process, involving both the employees who handled our items and the cashier.

The staff member at the exit pointed out the missed item and suggested we return to the checkout to pay for it. Under normal circumstances, this might not have been a significant issue. However, given that I was assisting my elderly mother, returning through the busy store presented an inconvenient challenge, particularly to rectify an error we had no hand in creating.

In an attempt to resolve the situation swiftly, I requested that the item simply be removed from our cart, highlighting that the mistake was on Costco’s part as they managed the checkout process. The response from the employee was unexpectedly defensive; she insisted she had not made a personal error. I had to clarify that it was a systemic oversight by Costco, not her individually. This exchange was discomforting and made us feel wrongfully implicated in the oversight.

While I understand that errors can occur, the way this situation was handled lacked empathy and customer care. We left feeling frustrated and significantly inconvenienced, tarnishing our otherwise regular positive experiences with Costco. Effective customer service should prioritize quick and compassionate resolutions. Sadly, this was not our experience, leading me to question the value of my continued patronage with Costco.",1715128421,False

But the real star of the show is their meat, dairy, and produce room. It's enormous – seriously, the biggest I've ever seen. You can tell they've put a lot of thought into offering a wide variety for both personal and business needs.

What's cool about this place is that it's the only Costco Business Center in Houston, which adds to its uniqueness. And the cherry on top? It's not overcrowded. You can actually take your time browsing without feeling rushed or cramped.

The Kirkland Signature brand, exclusive to Costco, is often praised for offering high-quality products at lower prices compared to national brands. Additionally, Costco's selection includes everything from fresh produce and electronics to clothing and furniture, making it a one-stop shop for many consumers.

The membership model, while an upfront cost, typically pays for itself through the savings members enjoy over time. Members also benefit from services like pharmacy, optical, and photo centers, as well as travel and insurance deals.

Customer service at Costco is generally commendable. The staff are usually helpful, and the company’s return policy is notably generous, allowing for a hassle-free shopping experience.

Devon in the tire center happened to one to help me both times, lucky for me.  He gave exceptional service both times.

The second time was Saturday, 1/27/24, my tire was flat when I came out in the morning.  They were booked on appointments until Tuesday.  I was able to swap my spare and bring the flat tire in and leave it in as a walk in customer between appointments.  They were able to squeeze my repair in within 1-2 hours. I really appreciated this because I didn’t have to deal with it during the week with heavier traffic, work schedule, etc.

Costco's product range is nothing short of impressive. Whether I'm looking for fresh produce, electronics, clothing, or even furniture, Costco has it all. The diverse selection ensures I can cross off multiple items from my shopping list in a single visit.

The only downside with this Costco specifically, is the parking lot situation, people speed in this busy  parking lot trying to beat traffic only to end up getting stuck in traffic (a mindless move lol) and traffic gets clogged near the 3 way exit since the exit is a shared common intersection with other high traffic stores (seen a few accidents occurred in the past).

As a single father of twins, I rely heavily on the conveniences and cost savings that come with shopping at bulk stores like Costco. My primary go-to item is baby wipes, as Costco offers a great deal on the brand that has served my family since my daughters were born. Unfortunately, my recent experience at the Kendall Costco on Thursday, April 11, 2024, left me both extremely disappointed and embarrassed.

After a long day at work, I rushed to Costco to purchase a box of baby wipes—crucial for my twins—with the last of my budget before the next payday. To my dismay, at the checkout, I was informed that my Costco membership had expired back in December. I understand the policy, but given my tight financial situation, I wasn't prepared to renew my membership on the spot. I explained my predicament to the staff member and asked if I could just buy the wipes and renew my membership later when I had the funds. Unfortunately, the staff was unyielding, even after I requested to speak with a supervisor, insisting that I could not make any purchase without an active membership.

This policy adherence was disheartening. I was taken aback that a store as large as Costco, which prides itself on customer service and member satisfaction, could not accommodate a small exception during a time of evident need. This incident has motivated me to manage my affairs even more diligently; however, it has also prompted me to reconsider my loyalty to a store that may not support its customers during critical times.

I hope my feedback can prompt Costco to reconsider its policies or how they are enforced, particularly for loyal customers facing temporary hardships. A little flexibility and empathy can go a long way in maintaining customer loyalty and goodwill.",1713026246,False

It's worth noting that the tire in question is a Bridgestone Ecopia HL 422, with a 50,000-mile warranty. After discussing my dissatisfaction, I ended up paying $130, but additionally, they installed a tire with a very different tread pattern from the other 3 tires.

Yesterday, we raced over to this Costco location so that we could grab their all-in-one ready to put into oven Thanksgiving dinner before they sold out. Since we are just a family of two, the size of  their ready to cook dinner is perfect for us. We even have leftovers for the next 2 days. The price was $29.99 last year but was up to $40 this year. It's still a good value, and there is minimal work to do. Plus, it's delicious when done. You get the turkey breast, stuffing, gravy, mashed potatoes, green beans, and cranberries.  Just add the wine and dessert.

As we headed toward the crowded cash registers (the lines started back in the food aisles), an employee came over and took us over to a self serve register but he did the checking out for us and packing! What a blessing! I wish I had gotten his name! Very customer oriented. I added a star just for him.

Parking was a zoo as usual at holiday times! It took a while to find a spot out in the left field. Customers were quite impatient. We even got there just a half hour after Costco opened.

I am writing to express my disappointment with the customer service experience I encountered while attempting to add my husband to my Costco membership. Despite being a longstanding member of Costco, I was treated poorly by a customer service manager during this process.

Upon presenting my request, the manager cited Costco's policy regarding address verification, noting that our IDs did not display the same address. While I understand the importance of adhering to company policies, I was disheartened by the lack of empathy and willingness to explore alternative solutions.

As newlyweds in the process of updating our personal documentation, we encountered a hurdle that required understanding and flexibility from your staff. Unfortunately, the manager in question did not offer any assistance beyond citing policy, leaving us feeling dismissed and undervalued as customers.

I must commend the swift and efficient intervention of the supervisor we eventually sought assistance from. She demonstrated a keen understanding of our situation and promptly resolved the issue by accepting our joint bank account statement as proof of residence.

This incident highlights a significant gap in customer service on the part of the manager involved. While I appreciate the resolution provided by the supervisor, it is imperative that instances of poor service be addressed to ensure a positive shopping experience for all Costco members.

Thank you for your attention to this matter

The manager, Fritz, checked the device and confirmed that I made the purchase on the 21st through the cameras and that it was delivered to me by one of their salespeople. However, unfortunately, Fritz said he couldn't refund my money or give me the correct product. I returned in less than 24 hours, and Costco did nothing about it. This is outrageous; it has nothing to do with their internal problems. Furthermore, the manager told me they purchase from Apple, but when I went to the store, they said Costco doesn't have a selling partnership and doesn't buy directly from Apple.

I understand that policies are set in place, however, the way it was handled when I tried to use my Costco membership card and then my partners credit card was insane.

The cashier made this huge deal about it and tried to over explain the entire policy. She even offered for my partner (who lives in the same household) to apply for a membership. How in the world does that make any sense at all?? Sure, all I need to do is add him as the second card holder, but the way this entire thing was handled was just unprofessional. I politely asked if she could please call a manager over since this is the first time shopping there since this policy update. Luckily, the manager approved us to go ahead and go through and walked away.

Then, the cashier scanned all of our items (while looking at my partners card knowing they don’t take American Express and once everything was rang through the cashier said in a snarky tone “we don’t take American Express here.”

I had forgotten that they didn’t take the card and unfortunately we didn’t have another option for payment (and it was for his work) to complete the transaction.

She then proceeded to ask what she should do and I said “I guess you need to cancel the transaction and have someone put these items back, huh?”

To make it even better the ladies at the food court are mostly rude and yelling behind the counter about how they are out of things and they don’t care and they just have so much to do. I understand short staffing and being stressed out but as a customer it’s not that great to listen to that.

Once my membership expires in July of this year I do not plan on renewing because Costco (as a company) seems to not care about their customer service for their shoppers and is making it more difficult to just go into their stores and shop. I’ve already signed up for a Sam’s Club membership and it’s 100 times better already.

Saturday December 17, I thought, was the day I would finally become a member. For some reason, I thought membership cost $100. The Goldstar membership is only $60. It's the executive membership that's $120.

One of the things I looked for when I entered the store was the price of fuel. I couldn't find a sign with the prices. However, an employee at the membership counter told me that their fuel price is only $2.41 per gallon. At Hy-Vee, it's $3.09! Wow! I found out you don't have to be a member to look around the store or to go to the food court. That's nice! I took the opportunity to look around.

I found several things I put on my mental list of things I might buy in the future. I also enjoyed their food sample stations. They have several of them spread around the store. I saw a wide range of products from TVs, Bose headphones, chairs, a grocery store section, and plenty of snacks. Oh, I could get into trouble with all the snacks they sell here. I was disappointed when I found out their optical center doesn't work with the company I have for vision insurance which is Eye Med. It is worth mentioning that the reason I wanted a Costco membership instead of a Sam's membership is Costco has a reputation for paying and treating their employee much better.

After taking a good look around, I walked back to the membership counter to buy a membership. The woman who helped me gave me a lot of helpful information, and I could tell she really wanted me to sign up for the Executive membership. She also encouraged me to sign up for a Costco Visa credit card. I said I was interested in the Goldstar membership. As she was taking my information, I asked if Costco takes Apple Pay. She said, ""Only if it's linked to a Visa credit or debit card."" And that's why I am giving Costco 4 stars instead of 5. I have never heard of a store that won't take Mastercard.

I only needed a few things so I didn't get a cart. She needed to see my Costco card and check my identity for some reason and I didn't have a third hand to get out my card.

I put my card away, wait a moment to step up to scan, and of course I have to get my card out again. There's no where to put my stuff and I can't set it anywhere near the self checkout machine. So I set it on the floor, get out my card again.

I'm in this store a couple times a week and I've never seen them really check my card in a regular checkout aisle. Is self checkout some awesome place and I'm just missing out? Don't you want people to want to use self checkout? You don't act like it.

You need to find a better way to accommodate people without carts which you should be doing already at self checkout. Have an empty cart sitting around or something.

One of the main reasons is we live on the 3rd story of an apartment complex.  We like to be able to put items in the boxes to accommodate for that.  Usually they'll scan the heavy and or big items for us at self check out.  However on this particular occasion we got denied use of the self check out lanes by an employee who said we had to many items.  We had 14 items total.  We had two milks and 1 Capri sun pack.  That would have been considered heavy. We have done self check out numerous times with wayyy way more items before and no problem.  We triggered the over weight warning once on a separate occasion.  So we are aware of it.  Again usually employees offer to scan heavy and big items so I'm very  confused as to why we were denied use.

She goes through each item individually and found 1 out of 4 egg cartons was not ringed up properly. The approach was pretty unprofessional. Its not my fault that your team missed an item. It's literally 1% of what I purchased. There is a massive line behind me and people watching as My family including our newborn son is being held because of a carton of eggs. Anyways she forced me to leave my family and says I have to go to the tire center to pay for the eggs. I'm definitely not happy at this point. The guy at the tire center could tell as I'm standing in line. He was the only person in this scenario who showed any empathy. Turns out the lady sent me to the wrong location. I was suppose to go to the other side of the aisle where a lady was standing by some tires. Now this small petite blond woman seemed to continue the vibe of the lady at the door and treated me like I was trash. She said ""I was standing here the whole time"" and continued to give me ""stink eye"" the entire time. Finally were done here she begrudgingly gives me my receipt and I go on my way back to Lady #1 who of course once again checks my receipt to make sure I didn't steal the eggs. My $700 purchase made me back 2% and my credit card I used made me an additional 1.5%. I made $24.50 on this transaction with Costco. Why would I steal a $7 egg carton....?

They move customers in and out of their facility in record-breaking, timely manner.

My Time-Tested Costco Wholesale ""Parking Lot Sweep""
My strategy for securing fast parking.  Sorry (I played high school football).  It's football season.  I couldn't resist. So, ready?  Here goes.  Is your helmet secure, shoulders pads firmly tied down and mouth piece in place?  Ready, set, hut ... for the Costco Wholesale ""Parking Lot Sweep."" Now, first you've stayed away from Dillingham Boulevard.  It's a mess out there with rail construction.  Forget the Mauka (mountain-side) approach.  Instead, charge Costco from Nimitiz Highway, right?  Your BEST BET (I believe) is the Makai (ocean side) approach. Thank you for the wait.

My ""Costco Wholesale Parking Lot Sweep"" Images Are Now Posted.  So, for me at least, my fully tested ""true and tried"" ""Costco Parking Lot Sweep"" always yields my strategic outcome.  To date, I have always found my one needed spot on every parking foray.  So similarly, to YOU my reader, may ""the sweep"" be with you!!!

NOW, I also have my carefully developed priorities list of ""healthy foods and drinks"".  For me at least, they have those ""body nourishing special foods and accompanying drinks."" IF you look carefully for them.  The fruits (on my list) include avacados, bananas, blueberries (fresh and frozen), raisins (and grapes), kiwifruits (chock full of vitamin C).  (NOTE: PLEASE SEE my POB 1 post for more details).  They have eggs, milk (2%), juices (orange and POG), whole wheat breads and green vegetables (like spinach, broccoli, and potatos).  They have peanut butter and jams (strawberry is my favorite).  And, their's is a wide selection of red wines.  Mind you, this is my very personal list (after consultation with my doctors and nurses as well as internet and YouTube sources) of what I personally believe are the healthiest foods.

Oh yes.  And, there is Kirkland 100 % Columbian dark roast coffee.  I love the rich flavor.  It remains my favorite.

And, I'm still getting acquainted with the variety of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (in dark glass bottles with .5 % maximum acidity) from the Mediterranean (Kirkland's Toscano P.G.I from Tuscany, Italy) and .3% maximum acidity Kirkland's California Cuyana Valley, Fall 2022 harvest.  A CAUTIONARY NOTE:  There are fraudulent, or diluted olive oils on the market.  (Here, I'm still on my learning curve).  I need patience.  Please see my latest posts on these developments.

SO, PLEASE CAREFULLY read the labels (harvest in fall, harvest location (one locale?), production methods, expiration dates, maximimum acidity, .5%, .3% etc, if available).  They should be on your olive oil containers, which should be bottled in dark glass.  These are the current standards that I know.

To your health!!!",1710754693,False

I have been a member of Costco for years, and this is where we do 80%of our grocery shopping. This particular Costco in Kailua Kona is frequently visited by locals and tourists. Because this is the only costco on the island, people from all over come here one a week or bi weekly to get their groceries. Keep in mind that the weekends you may experience heavy traffic! Just be prepared.

First and foremost, the staff at this location are incredibly friendly and helpful. They truly embody the ""Aloha Spirit,"" making our shopping experience all the more enjoyable. Whenever we need assistance or have questions about any products, they are always available and eager to help.

One of the things we love most about this Costco is the great selection of local favorites. They consistently have a fantastic assortment of new, unique, and innovative products available, and we never fail to discover something new each time we visit. Additionally, their inventory is always well-stocked with beach gear, making it our go-to spot for all our beach essentials! This is where we shop for nuts to give to our family as gifts. They also carry local restaurant gift cards to Umekes or macaroni and grill at a discounted price.

At this Costco, you can find everything you need at unbeatable prices, and that includes gas! With a gas station conveniently located nearby, it's easy to fill up our vehicle while also stocking up on groceries, housewares, and beyond.

We also appreciate the concession area in the front of the store, perfect for grabbing a quick and delicious snack after a day full of shopping. It's another perk that makes this location stand out from the rest.

I cannot recommend the Costco in Kailua Kona enough.

But remember to look at quantity limits (per day) when buying if getting gifts so you're not trying to buy over limit in a single day.

The macadamia nuts, chocolate covered or otherwise, sold here are HUGE, super tasty!

They have all sorts of dried seafood snacks, fresh seaweed salad, kimchi imported from Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, etc.

DON'T BUY CUT FRUIT (papayas, pineapples, mangos) at Costco.  The local Farmer's Market or KTA Superstores carry local Hawaiian grown produce which is MUCH TASTIER and SWEETER than Costco's.

Definitely buy the 24 slice La Tour Bakery raisin bread, it is so good on its own, buttered, jammed, for sandwiches or French toast.  It's only sold in the Hawaiian islands. How good is it?  An entire floor to top section was full of this bread 3 days ago, today there was 4 left.  We bought 2 to take back to the mainland!

If you have the storage space and enough people in your family to warrant bulk shopping then warehouse buying is usually the way to go.  Most of the time Costco's every day prices are cheaper than even the sale prices at the markets and department stores.

You can also purchase gasoline there at a huge savings over a gas station and they also have a tire department if you need new tires for your car.

Costco also offers a Citibank rewards VISA credit card.  You get between 1% to 4% rewards benefits that are paid to you in a check when your cycle ends.  Depending on what you use the charge card for you can end up with a nice rewards check once a year that can be cashed or used to pay for your purchase at the register.  Whatever leftover bonus money you don't spend is given back to you in cash.  So if your bonus check is $400 and your bill is only $200 you get $200 in cash back.  It's a great deal and my favorite part of having the rewards card.  You can use the card anywhere VISA is accepted.

Costco has a pharmacy where you can pick up your medications and you will find a little bit of just about everything in the stores.  Most of it is food products but you can also get household items, appliances, automotive, hardware, electrical items, furniture, electronics, paper goods, cleaning items, over the counter pharmacy items, fresh flowers and orchids, freshly baked pies, cookies, breads, and pastries, cigarettes, liquor, ready made cooked foods such as a roasted chicken  for around $5 and so much more.",1574738253,False

I understand the corporate push for Costco app since it generates data but please don't misguide customers about policy changes like 'no returns without app or print receipt'. If that is your policy, clearly display it at the door and at the cashier and I'll think thrice before picking an item from your shelf. -1 star

The cashiers are being measured for the number of customers they push through. As a result, they have lost the ability to be kind. They are visibly stressed when one customer with a large number of items approaches instead of being happy about higher spending per household.

Seeking resolution, I requested to speak with a manager. Unfortunately, no one responded for nearly 30 minutes, prompting me to locate a manager inside the store. To my dismay, the manager and Celsira conversed in Spanish, despite my request for English, adding to my frustration.

Either way, I'm gonna give Costco a 2 out of 5 star in this Google review because I'm tired of the experience I've been having at the Costco food court. Enough is enough!

Costco pizza is a 9 out of 10! I would give it a 10 if they brought back the veggie pizza and Supreme pizza options. (hint hint)

But the issue and situation with the food courts at the two Costcos I frequent is a mess (Alexandria Rt 1 and Woodbridge Potomac Mills). The wait time for the whole pizzas can be over 40 minutes which truthfully that isn't the issue. I wait without much complaint as long as 1.5 hours for 2 pizzas at least once a month. My issue is the gaggle of people,  poor organization/flow of service and the minimal customer service that I continue to get. It's obviously not just me because most of the customers are feeling the same frustration when I'm there.

Today,  I experienced the worst customer service I've ever experienced at Costco. I won't mention his name although I seriously debated it bc he was rude to me and his co-worker that was trying to help me. And it's not the 1st time I've experienced it or seen it.

He should not be customer facing with that type of disposition. I thank the manager Jasmine and the supervisor and the employee that was actually trying to help me get the drinks for my kids and I while I waited for the pizza. With a 30 minute wait time getting your other items IF you want them should not be a problem-and normally isn't with anyone else but him. He rudely told his coworker that I could wait eventhough they were calling orders past my number. He said it 3 times while I was standing in front of him as if I wasn't there and as if she wasn't allowed to help me as if he was in charge. I don't know who he thought he was dealing with. I kept my cool but addressed his rude customer service and asked why I couldn't get my items while I wait for my pizza and asked for a manager. After talking to the supervisor who was helpful but I asked for a manager because I needed to ensure I was heard.

Now please keep in mind I rarely write negative reviews bc I recognize that everyone's experiences are different and I like to give places chances to do better but poor customer service is a huge problem that is so easy to avoid and easy to correct with a little bit of courtesy and respect. Please note I've worked at Taco Bell, McDonald's, TGI Fridays, Golden Corral and other restaurants and customer service jobs in highschool and college and even after I graduated. I am a process improvement and project manager and if anyone asked me I'd love to give some simple recommendations for my beloved Costco to improve the crappy experiences I and many others have had with the food court.

I also would like to say that I feel bad for the employees at the food court because it's a pressure cooker and I doubt it's an easy job dealing with the crowds of people that they serve all day. Thank you to all of you for serving us this yummy and great priced food!

But it's 2024 and I hope you do better and expect more from your employees and take time to assess and improve the efficiency at your food court.

Will I stop going to Costco, heck no! But I will definitely continue to be a vocal customer if or when I get poor customer service. Just being real with you. Overall Costco gets a 8 out of 10 most days but today and in regards to the food court experiences today and in the past, they get a 3 out of 10 for customer service (but like I said earlier a 9 out of 10 for the food! Can't beat the quality and price!

Quality food:  recently I bought a package of chicken thighs (see pictures below).   In the past, each portion (small individual package) had 3 big thighs, and a random small piece, maybe 4 if smaller  I guess to meet the weightcriteria., .

Today I cleaned and seasoned 3 individual packages (normally 10 thighs).  The pieces of chicken were so small that I had 22 pieces of chicken.  More than twice the normal amount.  After removing the skin, the skin, I weighted a few pieces and all of them were 2.6 oz.- 3.5 oz.  18 out 22 pieces were super small and 4 smaller than normal but kind of acceptable.   Imagine how small after cooked.

The other part of the poor quality control (chicken grade F) was so bad they put a piece of oddly cutted  leg was included in one of the small package.

Please start selling grade A chicken.  Mot this garbage.

2a.  I went to Costco to return something I bought long time ago.  Oddly, the person could not fi d the item in the system.  Initially she told me she could not go X amount of years.  When I insisted indicating I have returned older stuff, she was able to go as far as necessary in my purchase history.

She still could not find any of the items.  I suggested to search by product manufacturer, brand or object key word.  She told me the system didn't had the capability.  She can only look by department number and check what I bought classified as part of the department.

Eventually she called a manager.  A guy named Llamar confessed that Costco was limiting the items of your purchasing history because people was abusing the warranty.

I replied what that has to do with me?  The Costco contract with their members was 100% satisfaction warranty.  The only items with time limit are the electronics.  Just as a note, in the past I have returned items 10 months after the initial purchase because I didn't had the pressure of a standard warranty.  Even when I used to go to Costco twice a week.

Of course this change of business model was not publicly announced to the Costco members.

2b.  In similar fashion but more despicable, an old man (looked like late 60s or early 70s) was returning a Home Theather speaker system.  A kid already reviewed the components and gave the green light to the cashier to refund the money.  Suddenly a manager called Elmer arrived and questioned in a rude manner the old man.  The kid was ordered to take everything out humiliating the customer and eventually he agreed the item could be returned no before intimidating the young employee and the customer.

3.  Years ago, the gas also used to be much cheaper than the competition.   $0.50 less per gallon easily.   I used to refuel twice a week due my long commute.  Until recently,  there was no difference in gas prices.  Now, Costco gas prices are competitive but not significantly cheaper.  Not even with the 2% of executive membership refund is enough to go lower than the competition.

4.  In the past, I used get $80-$110 in rewards refund from my executive membership. With high prices, I stopped buying as much.  My last refund was just $25 because I started buying at other better priced grocery stores like Aldi's. I switched to a regular membership because it is no longer justifiable to keep the executive membership.

Costco is behaving so cheap that almost look like Walmart. Many shopping carts need the casters replaced.  See the pictures showing the shopping carts that doesn't work because you have to struggle pushing it with the casters with no rubber or the rubber in the casters are falling apart. You are pushing the biggest shopping cart of all retailers, with over $400 in products, super heavy and it wobbles because they don't have the decency to replace the casters.",1714291444,False

The cheese, as you can see, is half eaten. They’re individually wrapped, and it wasn’t until I tasted something funny that I had to spit it out.

All this to say, I have consistently noticed that Costco’s fridges are significantly lacking in their ability to keep things cool. I’ve even begun pulling from the back just to ensure freshness, but maybe they’re letting things sit out for a long time before refrigeration?? I buy their chicken skewers and meatballs regularly, and now that feels unsafe to say the least.

I’m thoroughly disgusted as I ate half this cheese (and have eaten MANY pieces from this package already).

I’m a new executive member and this will be my second time using my card. The first wasn’t a pleasant experience because the man in the front stops you too look at your Card and didn’t even let us explain we were there to pick up our card .
But the 2nd time was really something completely unnecessary. As we walked in, I got cleared because I showed my member ID I was with my mother and 3 children all which were sitting in the cart and 1 was walking with grandma . As I was in the  plates I notice a man looking at me and the kids between isles I wanted to confirm to see if he was following me and I went back and forth in my isle and he djd the same as I. I then kept my eye on the white older male from the plates all the way to the freezers in the back the man happened to be following me. My daughter noticed and began to cry because he was now pushing his eye contact by looking between the isles and literally copying every move I made so I decided to stand still and wait we were standing still for about 5min or more and the white older male didn’t move . He then showed face and was on his phone I then felt so scared so many things happening with kidnapping children I thought the worst with this man. I called over manger that were on the floor and explained the situation. The tan manger saw the man and smiled at him like he knew him and female manger acted as if she was terrified and one other coworker that saw my daughter crying asked what was the matter I explained she went to look at the male and confirmed he was a UNDERCOVER SHOPPER ! a undercover shopper!! As I was waiting for the manger to clear the guy and return they instead stood by the man and never came to me to explain the issue . My mother then approached the white male and mangers! They lied to my mother and didn’t want to reveal the undercover shopper . They didn’t care about telling us the truth so that we can shop in peace. The Costco has so much protocols so much steps to leave that store they have one way in and one way out and everything you buy there is huge! I had 3 kids and a older women with me with the most smallest bags. My kids were under control I was admiring the store for the second time . Why were we a suspect the white male was going to continue doing that while I exit the store whyyy!!!! When we pay the check you and count everything . When we leave they check our receipts and count everything !!! Like was that needed . Costco needs to do a better job with this. They made us feel like we were criminals They made my daughter fear, thinking that this man was going to harm us! I couldn’t shop in Pise and I couldn’t buy my things. I left my things because again the managers never came to meet to explain what was going on only one of the coworkers.Waa kind of enough to explain who he was . I had to leave my things my children were afraid and they didn’t understand the role of this man in the store. I pay for membership in doing all things right . I called the store and im  waiting for them to supposedly check the cameras . The lady on the phone playing her part and didn’t want to confirm the man and redirect what I actually saw! I’m so disappointed

My experience has been horrible here Please be aware of their undercover shoppers and always confirm who they are. The world isn’t the same and we can’t go by people stalking us throughout the store and give it a slap in the back and say it’s OK because it’s not OK we live in the world where people pray on children and pray on women, they need to respect that and they need to stop treating their goods like gold ! Again, Costco it’s not OK you have all your security measures. You clear people in the front and you clear people when they pay and you clear people when they leave what else do you want leave the shoppers alone and seek out people that truly are stealing and if you suspected us stealing, then wait for me at the end, but don’t follow me throughout the whole entire store.",1707773215,False

Huge parking lot, with easy parking. Huge and easy access shopping cart corral. Much larger walking space for shoppers getting into the store, larger main aisles and larger side aisles. Plus nothing blocking the cash register area, so the lines are much easier to manage compared with a traditional Costco where the cash register area is a mess filled with an extra row of food and snacks limiting and chocking the line of shoppers waiting to purchase to just 2 or 3 carts before the line has to bend in a huge mess.

The location itself is very convenient being next door to the Willowbrook mall, BJs and a movie theater.

Prices are awesome for almost everything. If something is not on sale, just be patient and come back again another day.

The only negatives I have pertain to all Costcos and not just this location:
Negative 1 are the Pantene shampoo and conditioner bottles used to be $9 per bottle until Bidenflation hit and now overnight the price jumped for no reason.. both are now $14 per bottle.. same stuff inside, same volume/quantity, same quality but price is $5 higher. Not made of gold or precious metals. Just greed. Luckily Costco realized the mess of this mistake and now often drops the price to $9 on sale usually once per month since at the $14 price not many people are buying it.

Negative 2 is the Costco milk bottles. Years ago the bottles were identical to normal grocery store milk bottles. Then they redesigned the bottles to be a more square shape. The two problems with this new design are the safety seal and the pouring dynamics. The new safety seal is nearly impossible to remove without hurting yourself or using a knife or fork to stab it open and often I see these milk bottles with faulty seals that didn't totally seal or they sealed it in a way you can turn the cap all the way. Lots of defects and way worse than the traditional milk bottle seal. The pouring dynamics are also terrible. The new bottle shape makes it extremely difficult to pour the milk without spilling it all over the place. Really bad. Just bring back normal milk bottles please.

Negative 3 is the Kirkland brand bottled water in the 40 bottle case. These bottles used to be slightly thicker and slightly bigger caps which made the bottles stronger and caps would perfectly seal no problem. Then around a year ago some idiot at Kirkland redesigned the bottle to have less plastic to save Costco money, but rendering the bottles and water inside useless. If you drop the case by accident, more than likely a bunch of the bottles will pop open and spill everywhere due to the weak and very thin plastic and very thin caps that pop off if you barely touch them. And if you even carry 1 bottle it is likely the cap will pop off just holding it. Please bring back normal bottles and caps for this. In the mean time I buy Poland Spring water since they use normal thick water bottles with strong caps.

Negative 4 is Kirkland brand paper towels. Again in a stupid move to save money, Kirkland removed all the individual plastic wrap per roll of paper towels. So if you open the main seal holding all the rolls of paper towels, each roll can now easily get dirty from dust, spills, rain, snow, insects, dirt, falling on the floor, rolling in your car, falling on the ground outside.. there is now nothing to protect all the unused rolls. One of the most stupid ideas they ever had.. don't be fooled by them saying it is to save plastic. It is for them to save money and charge us full price while making all your unused paper towels in storage much easier to get dirty becoming useless and then forcing you to go back to Costco and buy more rolls sooner. So I buy Bounty towels instead since they are logical and still have individually wrapped rolls to protect your unused towel rolls that are in storage.",1705770703,False

I wanted to share that while I understand why we should love the fact that 50% less plastic is being used for this high volume product, the sustainability factor after opening the bag goes down significantly which creates an issue for storage and cleanliness.

Subtracting plastic from another product perhaps is a better plan as now we must open the entire bag and expose all the paper towels at once.

I’m sure this is saving Costco millions of dollars but it’s inconvenient as I have had to purchase additional plastic ware to house this product in storage.

Back in the day Costco used to be about quality products, yes buying bulk saves money but you could always count on getting a high quality product. These days I’m not sure we save much money and the quality on most products are not good at all and is you start looking at where their products come from it’s mainly from China. I know it’s hard to not get anything from there but I was shocked to see how much food products are from China. Yes it’s cheaper but they have almost no regulations so you don’t know what kind of low level poison you are ingesting. Another thing is that I used to go to Costco almost weekly because the produce was so good, I’m not sure if it’s because ok Stevens is not as busy as other locations but the produce has been sub standard for a long time now. I get much better quality at the grocery store and because I’m not throwing a bunch away I am saving by not buying from Costco anymore. Lastly you have always had to show your card at checkout and someone checks you’re product as you leave. My last visit was a tough one, I had to wait to get in because they were checking cards, had to wait to check out now there is a long line to get out because they are checking every single item, I snapped at the gal checking products and grabbed by receipt from her which was rude and wrong on on my part so I apologize for that. I called and talked to the manager and apologized and asked why they they were checking every item instead of a quick scan.he pretty much blamed it on the checkers and it helps them save on shrink.

After we found the correct tires and price, I mentioned that I was worried about the time it would take for them to arrive since I needed to drive 400 miles for work within the next few days. Carlos went back out to look at my tires and explained that it would be dangerous for me to drive such a distance. He also had this verified by his supervisor.  Thanks to him, I quickly rented a car and avoided a potentially dangerous scenario where my tires could have blown out.

As a regular at Costco Pleasant Prairie, I’ve come to appreciate the store’s rhythm throughout the week. During the weekends, the hustle and bustle are expected, with crowds bustling through the aisles. However, it’s the weekdays that truly shine for me.

On a typical weekday, the store transforms into a tranquil haven, where one can shop at a leisurely pace without the pressure of navigating through a sea of carts. The calm atmosphere allows for a more thoughtful shopping experience, whether I’m browsing the latest electronics or restocking the pantry.

What keeps me anchored to this Costco, apart from the wide selection of products, is the unbeatable gas prices. Consistently offering the best rates in the area, it’s become my go-to spot for fueling up my vehicle, adding to the overall value of my membership.

For a big family as big as 4+ people, the store has good durable household & food products worth the value compared to other retailers.

I mainly like about the store the fact that they almost always sell the same items you have accustomed to buying at this place. Lately though, allot of my favorite products either discounted or temporary unavailable, for whatever reason few of which are: bacon wrapped chicken cutlets which went MIA since last year. Also haven’t seen the $100 smoked prosciutto meat leg. It used to come around winter season & made an excellent gift, but I haven’t seen it this winter. Occasionally I also see some out of stock favorites but they return after 2 weeks give or take.

Costco has mainly Kirkland brand as their supplier as well as other big verity of organic non GMO products. Though there still a few bioengineered stuff seen in the back of the contents label.

I like the fact that they promote their products to taste them out prior buying. And truth be told 95% of the stuff I tried as sampler I ended up buying and it was good. So I’m glad they have the samplers because had I not tried it myself or someone recommended, I would have never purchased it out of blue.

Parking at this location is always packed, no matter the day or the hour. But I calculated best time to shop at Costco is after 3, during weekday, between Mon-Thur. Less people at the store & close open parking spots.

But in order to shop at their store you need a membership card. Otherwise they won’t allow you to make a purchase. Unless maybe if you have a guest pass. Not sure about that. But what I’m sure of 150% is that membership has to be 1 per (2 people) household. So for example there are 2 membership cards for household, say one in your name another for a spouse. Yet if your mom/dad/sibling wishes to visit the store without any of you, your household family members will not be able to shop/buy if their name isn’t on that card. They recently changed their policy about that. :(

We have a large family, brothers & sisters all under one big roof. Been buying at Costco for years, our household main person is my older brother. So it was his & his wife names on the cards. We never had issues cuz all of us are with the same last name/address. Once or twice they asked for ID to check home address but not since October 2023. We used to be able to shop there without an issue until they strictly enforced the other people of the household to pay for the annual membership. I think it’s super unfair to enforce that rule and they will only loos money on that whole membership issue which is $60/year (the lowest). Imagine how much $ people spend daily… I can reassure you some members of my family refused to shop this place because they enforced their membership. Anyway it’s their loss. But what I have been told of recently, they are planning to get rid of physical cards & scan membership from smartphones.",1702946226,False

I could almost guarantee that if I made them at home, they wouldn't even give them a try. But, because they are samples, the kids tried them and loved them. Now I can make them at home.

The biggest draw, however, is the hot food deli. You can't beat their pizza and their $1.50 hot dog and soda combo. On weekends prepare to wait a while as there can be a substantial crowd waiting on food.

My boys had the bright idea to get a Costco Membership today. We were immediately stopped upon entering the store even though the two people in front of us weren't stopped. After my experience in the store today I'm going to attribute it to the fact that I hadn't gotten a fresh blowout this morning nor do I shop at J. Crew or Macy's.
We went to the desk to get a standard Membership because we just wanted to check the place out. HOW DARE WE ONLY WANT THE STANDARD MEMBERSHIP!!! We were met by Lisa, whom was extremely aggressive and got angry that I had researched the memberships ahead of time and knew what I wanted. She was not about to hear it. Her attitude was so nasty I wanted to just leave, but my boys really wanted to check it out. So she got the same attitude she was giving from me.
This place IS NOT for people with anxiety or PTSD.  Don't expect to be able to browse. If you want a rotisserie chicken you're waiting in a line for half an hour if not more.
It's just too much here. Noone needs this much food unless you have a family of 12 or more. That's the only way I'd find this place worth it.
It's also the hot spot to take your family of 13 for lunch. Trying to go down an asile while mom and her wild children are standing in line for a sample is ridiculous.  Technically this is a playground with snacks....
Even the employees have had it here. Everyone of the employees given out samples were exasperated.  Pretty sure the last one I saw was contemplating his life choices and the life was drained from him when a mom in plaid and her puffer vest pulled up with her 4 young children whom were bouncing and screaming as the employee tried to prepare the children's free lunch for the day.
The Membership is ridiculous.  2 cards? Only two people can share the membership in a household??? And someone in your home can't use your card....You HAVE to be there and YOU have to pay for your items.
Being watched like a hawk while my son was checking out is scary.
Felt like I was being accused of stealing the way my sons items were gone through as we left.
Constantly having to show our membership card.
It was too much. I was ready to throw hands with anyone just trying to leave.
I'll be canceling the membership.  Not worth anyone's mental health here.

Walking through the store, I am always amazed by the variety and value Costco provides. The bulk packaging is not only cost-effective but also eco-friendly, reducing unnecessary waste. The fresh produce section boasts a wide selection of fruits and vegetables that are consistently fresh and delicious. Their Kirkland Signature brand is a testament to their commitment to delivering superior quality at an affordable price.

The friendly and helpful staff members add to the positive experience. Navigating the store is a breeze, and their willingness to assist makes every visit a pleasure. Plus, the samples offered throughout the store provide a delightful treat and a chance to try new products.

But let's not forget about the membership perks! The gas prices alone make the membership fee worthwhile. It's incredibly convenient to fuel up at the end of a shopping trip, and the savings quickly add up over time.

In conclusion, Costco's commitment to excellence shines through in every aspect of their operation.

The employee that walked away, told me that the car batteries are pro rated over a year’s time and said o needed to pay $75 for my battery exchange. The battery was only 8 months old and sells for $110. After the confusion I realized the $65 was the cost of membership renewal (which I told him to include in this transaction since I had to renew). I’ve seen him working at this location for years now. How could he not know what he’s ringing up? That’s very concerning especially since he’s handling money for this place.

Half of what I own has probably been purchased from Costco. I’ve never been disappointed by a product.

They have a an excellent electronics section. Their TV selection has a great variety of makes and models. They have the best policy on headphones and ear buds - LIFETIME SATISFACTION GUARANTEE (if you don’t believe me talk to someone in the store or look online).

As a whole the warehouse carries a diverse selection of items. They continue to get new products and do a nice job rotating them throughout the store .

If you’re a first timer, just get one of the rotisserie chickens. I promise it’s not all hype, they’re great.

My most recent purchase has been a Lasko space heater. Couldn’t be happier. The heater is efficient at warming up any regular sized room in a house or office. It has all the bells whistles and more for only $50. More importantly it’s very quiet.

They usually have the cheapest fuel in town. If you play the membership/credit card game right you’re able to earn lots of cash back.

Went with my cousin as her guest and shopped for 2 hours. Went to split the payment in line separating hers from mine and was told the member has to pay or I can pay cash. Over 150$. Does anyone carry that much cash on them??

The rude cashier then states it’s been a rule guests must pay cash and I mention I was not aware. She says there’s are signs everywhere then I ask if she can make an exception this time since this is the first I’ve heard of the rule.

She calls manager over who also gives me a hard time I explain that I’ve come to this Costco many times with my a member and split payment and they say those employees weren’t doing their jobs. He then says “well it seems like we’ve made exceptions for you in the past” where I respond: “it’s not an exception if I didn’t know it was a rule in the first place” after about 5 mins of back and fourth and him not budging  I was finally like “ok are you guys going to put all the stuff back? Or make an exception?” As a little check mate and he said “ok let it through”

Don’t understand why Cash vs Debit matters?? Most businesses prefer cards. Only heard of cash preferred for the companies looking to be under the table or tax evasion. Maybe trying to save on processing fees.

Make this “Rule” well known somehow!!!",1713589169,False

Parking is busy, but the packing is ample. And the usual Costco size parking spots make it easy to park, even if you have a truck.

Oddly, they have a walk-up eye test window that I've never seen anywhere.  The food court is indoors in front of the check-out lines, so it makes it tough to get by when people are waiting for their food.

My worst experience in a Costco food court was here.  They push you to use the kiosk to order your food even though there wasn't a line.  The counter was not friendly. They failed to even engage at all with people and only would be friendly to select people --- and we were not those people.  This was not an management issue but an employee issue.

The store was not crowded, and the lines moved pretty quickly. The selection was good, but the layout was oddly narrow and didn't flow as well as other Costcos in the same area. No employees working in Electronics or Jewelry or any of the major high-profile areas which was surprising on a pre-holiday Friday afternoon.

Self-checkout was not friendly either.  They even questioned if I was the person in the photo! I'm pretty sure I'm not an underage person trying use their parents Costco card.

In most cases, the unit prices were the same. In some cases Walmart was several cents cheaper and in other cases Costco was several cents cheaper. Now, for the non grocery items such as books, clothing, shoes, kitchen, and electronics, we found their prices to be higher than what you would pay for these items on Amazon.

Amazon has a chase card where you get 5-6% back on everything you buy.

The only reason it's getting 4-stars is because of inconsistent service from staff. I've had more than a couple disappointing experiences. More context below:
1. They fail to ask whether I need a box or act as if my asking for one is inconvenient
- Tiresome explaining I have a truck. Small items are free to move around the bed of my truck.
- More than a couple times I didn’t say something in time and ended up with no boxes to help manage smaller items. Very frustrating especially when dealing with items in glass containers!
2. Aggressive and inconsistent scanning of items by staff at self-checkout.
- Evidently, they do this to mitigate splitting orders? A friend was told this. They will randomly pick random items to scan, not just big items but small things like muffins or chicken. I’ve caught myself re-scanning items they already pre-scanned which would mean I’d be charged twice.I question whether I’ve re-scanned without catching myself?! It goes beyond courteous and is clearly contrived “assistance”. I have the higher tier membership and it’s very off putting having them disrupt my shopping experience with this ham-handing mitigation.
3. They seem to have backed off this one a little but for a time they were aggressively asking for a picture ID. Again, I pay for the higher tier membership. It’s off putting being subjected to the show me your papers bit.
4. General rudeness. It’s strange but there is a general smug attitude at times from some staff. Like they are doing me a favor letting me shop at their store. A moment that comes to mind is when I had a full paid-for cart and my children and I were getting food at the food court. An employee was standing by the end of one of the tables and I asked whether I could leave my cart beside the table while I ordered. Not really sure what other options there even are?! The gal was indignant and told me I can’t leave my cart there. I'd be blocking traffic. I asked where I’m supposed to put the cart and she just looked at me with an upset stare that I would even ask. I ended up moving my car back behind a closed down till. It was too far for comfort from our table but I did my best to keep an eye on it.

All of this said, I do love the store and there are a lot of courteous staff. That said there are noticeable examples of poorly executed management initiatives and a clear lack of courtesy from some staff that may demonstrate courtesy isn’t a high priority for some management.",1711124125,False

For the most part, Sam’s Club is leagues above Costco for a multitude of reasons. First, I don’t understand the need for employees constantly asking to see your membership. Last time I went in, I was asked by 4 different employees for my membership over a span of half an hour. One of the times was while I was at the self checkout. That one didn’t even make sense because I can’t access the self checkout without scanning my membership to begin with, so what was the point? The only thing positive I can say about this place is that they do have very good protein-friendly foods. From quick microwave-able options, to different cuts of meat, to protein snacks & shakes. However, most of these items sell out quickly and either don’t restock for a month or don’t restock at all. The app is also pretty useless too, since it doesn’t tell you where any items are located in the store or if it’s in-stock at all. Lastly, and I know this one is a bit of a nitpick, but the people who shop here are the absolute worst. I have never seen such a lack of spatial awareness and common sense in my entire life. People will run into you with their carts & block out aisles, then look at you as if you are the problem. I don’t think it’s fair to count that against Costco as a company, but I believe it is worth noting. I think your best bet would be to cancel that Costco membership and go to Sam’s club.",1710026764,False

It sounded cost effective even though were are a family of two.

Seven years later, we lost our dog, but we kept our Membership. Even though we don't go there often, the do have some of the best deal and unbelievable, customer focused policy.

Last year, my husband had a full knee replacement and his friend recommended that we get a recliner from Costco which helps people to stand up (the way it's designed). So, of course, it sounded like a good idea. My husband was on a mission to take his PT and knee exercises seriously because he loves playing golf more than anything in the world. I saw him sitting on the recliner less than 10 x in the year since we bought it.

Last November, I called Costco to see if I could return this ginormous recliner (it had been just over a year). Ironically, my husband had bounced back and was on his annual golf trip. The lady in customer service said if I brought it into the store, they would take it back. She assured me it was fine and to make sure the to bring any electronics associated with the chair.

Two weeks later, my husband and I took the chair back to Costco (with trepidation) because it didn't sound believable that we could actually return it for a full refund.

I rolled the recliner chair in a big, flat cart and took it to customer service. The person scanned my card and gave me a full refund.

I was elated!! I was happy to get the money back, but even happier to get rid of another piece of furniture which was taking up too much space!!

The way she goes about this entire thing is why I'm so irritated about it. She caught me off guard with how mean and rude she is. She's vile and doesn't know how to speak to people.

That being said, the check out experience is the bane of my experience there and will likely be the reason my family cancels our membership.

At Sam's Club, and a lot of normal smaller grocery stores, they have the option to check out via app. I wish you guys would adopt that option. Instead, if we go to self check out, we still have to show our card again. If we go to a cashier, that's a whole separate issue, only to have a person counting and touching every item, one by one.

Talked with the Costco person at the counter about getting a refund for the core battery I had brought back. Phone then rings at the counter and the Costco person answers it and now I am waiting. Eventually I walk away from the counter with the core battery. I definitely understand if the Costco person was on the phone when I walked up but this was just a lack of customer service the way it was handled by Costco. Option #1 could have been to not answer the phone until I completed the return. Option #2 could have been answering the phone and asking that customer to hold while the return was completed. Customer service is fading fast at Costco. All that will be left soon at Costco is pricing and once that is not appealing it will just become another big box store. Sad because it had been a great store for so long.

Edit: I returned to the same Costco to take the core battery back again and the same person was at the automotive counter. He (Steve) asked to scan the QR code to show the membership at Costco I had and I held the phone up. He then asked if he can take my phone. I asked if he scanned the QR code and he said he wasn't able to at the counter. I told him I was not going to provide him my phone and then he demand the account number which I provided. He gathered all the details of the car I have and then went to get a new battery off the shelf. I explained that I was returning the core battery that I had brought back to the counter. He said there was no record of a battery purchase. I then asked about the core battery for my wife's car battery which I had recently bought at Costco also. He again gathered all the details of the car and went to get a new battery off the shelf. I again explained that I was returning the core battery and was just looking for either of the two batteries I had purchased so the core battery could be returned. He said there was no record of that battery purchase either. I then asked to speak to the manager and he came over to the counter.
