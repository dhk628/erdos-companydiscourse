All in the same day I had slow movers (people who would check out every single item with a family of five or more which is totally ok, but they blocked off a lot of areas)

A lady who acted offended when I politely asked if she could move to get down an aisle bc she was enjoying a free sample, her cart sideways and I couldn’t fit my cart through ended up going the other way around. 

Someone stepped on my shoe and almost took it off completely 

Another lady had ran their cart into my ankles 😩

A who guy cut in front of me to check out sooner 

And another lady who Parked her cart right next to another so no one could get past, I tried pushing through and she got offended, but like why block off a whole aisle?

I was loading my car with my purchases and I noticed a Cadillac stopped a few cars away waiting for me to finish and pull out so they could have my spot. Normally I'd be like, ok, let me hurry a little and get out of your way.... But there were empty spots TWO CARS OVER. It was me, two more parked cars, an empty spot, another car, and then two empty spots, and then the cart corral. 

I went to take my cart to the corral and the dude honked at me. Yes, honked... And then made a hand gesture to hurry up. Are you freaking kidding me? 

Suddenly, the ten second wall to the cart corral took about forty seconds.... And I felt the need to rearrange my purchases in my trunk, and then check email for five minutes..... And finally the caddy drove down the aisle and out of sight.

1056,l3u64to,onegirlwolfpack,1715601013.0,"Phthalates are not the same thing as microplastics.  Phthalates are a type of chemical that leaches into the product.  Remember bpa?  Similar issue.  There aren’t ‘chunks’ breaking off into the food.  It’s more like a bag of tea steeping in water. 

Not that the end result isn’t taking in a harmful chemical, but I felt that it was important to make the distinction.  This issue is completely separate from microplastics.  Microplastics are defined as any kind of plastic (could contain phthalates, could not) less than a certain size. 

If you removed phthalates from all plastics, the plastic would still break down over time from wind or water erosion and enter the soil, air, water, and other animals we consume.  Until plastic consumption is either greatly reduced or eliminated the microplastics issue will continue to.  Removing phthalates or bpa will not eliminate the problem. 

Removing these chemicals may make microplastics less harmful once they’re in your body but they are often replaced with alternatives that are just as bad (what happened when they started removing bpa from products).",93.0

Other comments indicate that the ones tested in the article (Core Power) use a different bottle, both in terms of size and material, than the 30g Nutritional Plan ones.

The Nutritional Plan ones are a #1 type plastic, which is PETE.

Some quick googling tells me that PETE doesn't have the toxic orthophthalates that leech into foods. It's also BPA free.

However, when heated and/or recycled, apparently the PETE plastic can release some toxic and/or endocrine-disrupting compounds.

On the surface, it seems that when kept at ""normal"" temperautres, PETE plastic is reasonably safe and non-leeching. It's moreso the production, recycling, and disposal that's not great.

From some additional Googling, it looks like Fairlife also uses # 7 plastic for some of their products, which at first glance seems like a more problematic category. I'm not sure if this is used on the Core Power, or their larger containers of milk, or what.

I'm not a plastics expert by any means. I think we could all stand to reduce the amount of plastics in our lifes. As to whether the 30g Fair Life drinks are an issue - it seems that they're probably not as bad as the Core Power ones? But it would take actual testing to say with any amount of certainty.",17.0

Only certain types of plastic contain the toxic orthophthlates that can leech into products.

It would seem that for this specific Fairlife product (we're not sure about others), they're either using a bottle or a lining that has a much higher than expected amount of phthalates.

# Plastic Chemicals in Foods: What Our Tests Found

The 67 grocery store foods and 18 fast foods CR tested are listed in order of total phthalates per serving. While there is no level that scientists have confirmed as safe, lower levels are better. Our results show that although the chemicals are widespread in our food, levels can vary dramatically even among similar products, so in some cases you may be able to use our chart to choose products with lower levels.



Includes the 10 phthalates we tested for: BBP, DBP, DiBP, DCHP, DEP, DEHP, DnHP, DMP, DiNP, and DNOP. We also tested for three chemicals used as phthalate substitutes (DEHA, DEHT, and DINCH), and three bisphenols (BPA, BPS, and BPF), which are not shown in this chart.

North east Costco produce used to be the best I could get, strawberries would last an unbelievable 10 + days in the fridge - unwashed with a piece of paper towel to absorb any moisture.  I bought them every week. 

Now most of the time the berries have so much condensation on them - like they’re thawing out in the store -that they absolutely were not kept at the right temperature somewhere along the way… and many of them already have moldy ones in the package.  If I say something to the produce guys on the floor about it they look at the temperature gage on the wall and scoff at me.   The blueberries seem to make the trip all the way from Peru unscathed… but the strawberries from California/Florida cannot anymore??

I would first go to the manager and ask that it be given back. If you are disciplined you should add a retaliation claim to your complaint.  Finally, as added protection, go to your manager with another employee, as this will count as ""concerted activity"" that is protected by the NLRA.

Some businesses will donate a percentage of sales during a specific time and that is tax deductible because it comes from their income. I could see a business inflating prices for something like that, especially if it's someplace like a restaurant that is offering to donate a percentage of sales from some special meal or menu item it's offering.

What scenario could that have been?  I can only imagine one:  parents with a bunch of kids.  So, you had a bunch of kids with cups, and some trash, and it ALL ended up in a cart and not in the parking lot.  This is a win from a person who didn't have any available hands or time to put the cart away.  I would always find a way, so I will knock them for that, but why not look at the good that they did?

Just looking at the coddle online I'd imagine it's a better couch to sit in. However, I actually love the Friheten as a sleeper sofa when you combine it with a memory foam mattress topper because the way that it swings out is pretty solid and if you get a thick enough memory foam topper you don't feel any of the cushion gaps and I think it's comparable to an actual bed (Twin XL size btw). I've had multiple guests say that it was extremely comfy (again though you'd want a memory foam topper, I have a 2.5 lb gel swirl one from mattress topper). If you have guests over fairly frequently I'd probably go Friheten but if it's more of a once in a blue moon deal and assuming the Coddle is more comfortable as a couch I'd go with it.",1.0

I don't really foresee having guests over too often so it might be wise to get the one that's more comfortable as a couch and use a mattress topper like you suggested. I would love to try out the Coddle but I don't know if it's available at my local Costco. I'll need to check the next time I'm there, though that won't be for a while since I'm currently out of the country.

You or the gift recipient doesn't want to do that so they naturally are suspicious because somebody in this situation is being shady and it sounds like the person you gave the gift to.

One time one of my family members forgot to grab their passport for a trip. We were already at the airport and heading through security. It came down to a decision of leaving that family member behind or trying to get another flight out so they would have time to get their passport from home.

We called Costco Travel and asked for help. The Costco rep went way above and beyond to reschedule flights so that half my family could still go as planned and the other half went with the family member that forgot their passport so they wouldn't be alone. It saved us a lot of headaches.

1. Enterprise through Costco is NOT the same as Enterprise directly or through the Enterprise app. You have to wait in line at counter and they are less flexible on cars. I don’t use Enterprise through Costco in certain airports because I get screwed on waiting in line, or the car itself.

2. We booked Maui through Costco and the hotel would not give us two queens, only a king. Costco was not able to help.
