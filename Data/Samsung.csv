You turn it down to 0%, next video same thing boom it crashes at 100%.  Anyone having this issue? Been searching for hours on the internet not solution yet.

1crolib,l3zw0un,Romaiiiing,1715692073.0,I would say s24 base model since you don't take that much photo. The s24 take good photos already just like the s23. However if you are in a concert you may want the Ultra for its zoom lens. I used to always go for the best flagship until I realized myself that I don't use all the good stuff. I have the s23 Plus and the photo are good enough for my need and it take stunning photos.For my next phone I am also considering a base model.

The shops are run by a different company all together, so when you ask for a refund they legitimatly say 'You'll have to speak with Samsung' while wearing a samsung t-shirt.  They then like to defer to the carrier network as 'you bought the phone from them' which was amusing.

I see no reason to limit my charges. Its super handy to start from 100% because some days are hectic and I end up around 10% when I go to bed. For these exceptions every now and then I dont want to have to charge.",7.0

1cqxzu7,l3ui25y,j_aeli,1715606568.0,"I bought it for full price last year and it's still working fine now. But it doesn't mean it's good. Screen is too large so battery depletes fast. If you're using 120hz refresh rate, you'd only use it for about 5 hours before the battery is depleted. Using 60hz however, can extend it significantly. Most apps are not optimized for its landscape viewing, hell, sometimes even the portrait view is also messed up on some apps. S pen feels very light and small compared to the iPads' pencil. Its mount is also on the back of the tablet, which is very inconvenient but you can get used to it. But it's stupid. It can stick on the side of the tablet but the magnet isn't very strong there. Its pressure levels also only reaches around 4000. Most graphic tablets reach 8000. One good thing about it is that I never had to charge it once unless it was separated from my tablet for a long time.Tablet's also too big and heavy to carry around, you might as well as buy a laptop. One good thing about it though is it's like carrying a portable TV. You can watch and show people stuff with the bigass screen.The camera's not so bad either, it has an ultrawide mode on the front cam. Samsung DEX isn't as useful as you think it's be unless maybe you mainly use your tablet for work. It has a SD card slot, another good thing about it.So yeah, if you're gonna use it for drawing, get an iPad Air instead.",2.0
1cqxzu7,l3yrmpu,Putrid-Balance-4441,1715666783.0,"It really depends on what you do with it. For a lot of people, the Tab S Ultra line is simply too large for what they do. The Ultra is more of a tabletop device. Most people would have trouble cradling it in their arms while lounging on the couch for hours at a time.If the Ultra form factor isn't a problem for you (say, if you need it for art or video conferencing and it's going to spend most of its time on a table anyway), and assuming nothing is wrong with the tablet, then yes, I would consider that a good deal. The main difference between the Tab S8 Ultra and Tab S9 Ultra is water resistance.For me personally, the Plus form factor is the ideal size.The Plus size is better than the regular size because I sometimes need to read small text in e-textbooks, PDFs, and electronic comic books, and my eyes are decidedly older. With the Plus form factor, I can read small text without pinching and zooming while I'm on an elliptical machine or some other cardio machine.Other than that, I use it for long sessions curled up in my arms while reading e-books, doom-scrolling social media, or watching YouTube videos. I rarely stream movies or TV on my tablet.The Plus size is pretty much the maximum size device I can cradle in my arms for hours without fatigue. Any bigger than this, and I would have to limit my time on the couch with a tablet.Most people find the S-Pen better than Apple Pencil. Obviously, not everyone (looks at other comment).The regular (non-Plus, non-Ultra) is far more portable if you need something you can throw in a backpack and use on the go.If the tablet is going to spend most of its time in your arms rather than on a desk, do not get one of those official slim cases as they provide no protection from drops. If it's mostly on a table, the Ultra is fine, and you may find the built-in keyboard convenient. If you're using a more protective case, any old portable Bluetooth keyboard will do.",2.0

Clever and catchy. But I don't think it was always like that. It was just a drop in category from the S tier and if you follow Audi's approach, then that would be A series.

The S series could be named ""S for Sport"", just like in Audi, given the term ""Sport"" is universal, but I think it would make more sense for the S to be associated with Samsung; it's their flagship series, so it makes sense to name it according to the brand's initial (just like the A in Audi cars is the initial of the brand's own name).",1.0

1cotm8n,l3td6uf,cantpickaname8,1715580657.0,"I actually had this question not long ago. Here is what I would recommendThe Galaxy Buds 2 Pro: The sound quality is astonishing for earbuds, I'm a lowkey audiophile and out of all the earbuds I've tried these are definitely the best in Audio Quality. They fit very nicely into my ears, especially compared to the previous version. The battery life leaves a bit to be desired, with ANC on you're looking at about 3-4 hours of play and without it you can expect closer to the advertised 8 hours, they make up for this with how quickly they charge in the case. They are pretty expensive tho, on sale they'll generally go for about $170 US and without a sale up to about $225 US, you can find them for cheaper from time to time on places like Amazon.Raycons: Basically everyone has heard about these. They're cheap at about $80 US for their base model and they work well, they even have drequent sales and discount codes. I will say I haven't properly owned any since the ones I had from 2019-2021, the audio quality was better than the skullcandy earbuds I was used to and the battery would generally last most of the school day. The overall quality has seemingly gotten much much better since then, especially audio quality and fit. JBL: I haven't owned any however my girlfriend absolutely loves her pair of Wave 100TWS. They have a wide variety of options at an incredibly wide variety of prices. I have no real experience with their earbuds but I've been told that, while JBL makes really good Speakers and Audio equipment, their wirless buds aren't up to snuff. That said you can get a pair for like $35 US if they're on sale so I supposed with them it's likely very much a ""Get what you pay for"" sorta thing. Personally, I think the Buds 2 are the best buds overall. The quality is amazing and they pair well with Samsung phones. The Raycons would be my second choice, despite being cheaper the quality is pretty good, I don't really have any complaints. The JBLs seem like a mixed bag and I would avoid them if possible, people seem to love em or hate em, however they're very cheap for wireless buds so they're likely comparable to a cheap Casio, they do their job and if they break they're easy to replace.",1.0

I actually had it replaced after like 8 months at my local samsung store. It was free with samsung care. The next time I needed it replaced samsung said the repairs for the screen protector were only free the 1st year. You also couldn't do it yourself because removing it voided your warranty. I didn't want to pay and since my warranty was probably going to be voided either way, I just removed the screen protector and the phone looked good for a few more months. However a little while after, and I don't think this had anything to do with the screen protector, but pixels started to go out on the crease. I don't think this had to do with the crease since a friend I know had a similar issue but theirs was away from the crease. Also after like 3 months of no screen protector the screen started to get really scratched up. Honestly I wish the phone was more durable but I loved the phone so much.

Contacted Samsung support and was very frustrated by the service and tried to request that I return the product for a refund. They said no only a repair is the option because you have 15 days to return a product from purchase. Which is ridiculous, so I engaged them on twitter. Got incorrect information, including that they may refund it, but needed a tech to look at it first. Then they said they’d send someone to me to look at it. I got a call a few days later saying I didn’t ship it back yet, said I was told they’d send someone. Then told no they won’t do that it’s too far. Okay fine, so they had me send it for repair, whatever. So I send it in, get it back and the issue was fixed, but the coil whine when something’s plugged in was still present and now a very prominent green pixel is stuck directly in the center. At this point I’m so beyond with them, and I’m arguing with them via twitter to get a refund. I’m happy to ship it back, original box, components etc. but they are still being difficult. I’ve also stated that if they won’t do this I’ll just initiate a chargeback.Any advice on the best way to just get a refund? Frankly I will never buy another Samsung product.

1cndo1y,l36oijy,TealCatto,1715201019.0,"This is true except for that silly rumor about Samsung slowing phones down intentionally. They don't need to slow the S9 down intentionally, it would be a miracle if a phone that old was still fast. What about my LG G6 which came out the same year as the S8. LG isn't in the mobile market anymore so they have no reason to try to get me to buy a new phone. So why does it take 10-30 seconds to perform most actions? From what I read in groups like this, the S8 is actually still usable. My G6 is not.But other than that, yeah. I've said it before, there's no need to release a phone yearly. And watches, and headphones. They only do it because people who can't get dopamine any other way besides for yearly or twice a year upgrades would put them out of business. Garmin releases watches once every 2-4 years. They stagger model releases so they have something new every year but each model has a few years of a gap. Samsung can do it too, with the S, A, and Z series.People who jump on yearly upgrades are tiresome and ridiculous. Then they have to act as if it was worth the ""upgrade"" because photos are SO MUCH better (they'd fail to identify which camera took which photo in a blind test) and it's SO MUCH faster (yeah, because it's not bogged down with a year's worth of cache. Perform a factory reset last year's phone and it will be so much faster, too).I'm glad new models got 7 years of support. Even for people who won't use a phone for 7 years, this allows customers to choose an older model if they'd like. I wanted an S10e or Note 10 when the S22 came out. I wanted a small phone, and the S10e was a nice compact size, while Note 10 was the size of the base S22! But there was only one year of updates left so I chose the S22.",9.0

I know it sounds weird, but it does help frame differences better.In terms of Updates, The technology in an S22 is going to be a newer revision of what is in the S20FE. And both of those have newer revisions than the S9. If we look at the Wifi and Bluetooth of the 3 models, we can see the updates to the technology of the devices. S22 and S20FE support the same Wifi protocols (Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/6) and the S9 supports older Wifi Protocols (Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac). \[S9 doesn't support the 802.11 6 protocol\]Similar thing with Bluetooth, S20FE and S9 support bluetooth 5.0 while the S22 supports bluetooth 5.2.In terms of Features, this would be more like gaining and losing features and abilities. Like for example the headphone jack. S9 has one, S22 doesn't have one. We also can look at cameras, S9 has 1 rear camera while the S22 has 3 rear camera. So considering updates and feature changes.

A discussion often brought up by others in terms of the dearth of significant improvement in the past few years.  OP's question/point is valid.  The past 5 years have had an evolution, mostly in terms of improvements in software, while losing a number of phone (hardware) features - headphone jack, heart rate sensor, SD card, and MST, primarily.  Hardware additions have been minimal except for incremental improvements to camera, CPU, and screen.First, though, it would be a good idea to learn the difference between being wrong and being a liar.  Falsely accusing people of being liars is as bad as being a liar.  There is no indication OP was being a liar regarding slow downs.Physically, they both have cameras - one is better quality.  One does 5G (dropping back to the 1990's, BTW would be 2G or maybe 3G.  The S9 is significantly quicker with 4G.)  One has a headphone jack and heart rate sensor, an sdcard, and MST;  the other does not. Reharding water resistance,  the S9 had a headphone jack and sdcard and still had IP68, which is obviously as high an IP rating as OP needs since they've been doing so for years.  Video quality at 1080 is fine for the majority of people.  If you don't have a 4K tv, you probably have a 1080 one, and very few shows or movies are even above that on cable or normal streaming.  Obviously 1080 is not a real issue.  The S9 goes to 1440, too.  There are more differences due to OS/software than the phone features themselves.  OS updates are not phone features.  DEX is not a phone feature.  AI is not a phone feature (though some CPU features will aid it - but even the S24 features have come to the older phones so far).To OP's point, if you updated just their shared components -  the camera, screen, CPU to current versions - the S9 would be a better phone to most people than today's S24. Software (OS) would bring the rest.",1.0

1cndo1y,l380kg3,einTier,1715219333.0,"My first career was in software.  I almost made a really snarky comment about how Debian Linux is the last OS I remember not ever accused of being bloated.  They’re not building deliberately inflated OS’s to slow your stuff down and make you buy new shit. It’s just that it’s not feasible to design software for outdated hardware no matter how much some users would love it. Hardware upgrades.  That enables developers to do new cool stuff like Vista’s aero theme (that I still miss) or Android to offer a smoother, faster interface.  Users like seeing these improvements and if you don’t offer them, your competitors will.  On top of that, the new hardware allows for less optimized code so developers can focus their time (not infinite!) on other tasks, like additional features and more complex interfaces.  Now the product directors have to make a decision on what hardware this will run on.  The further back you go, the more you have to give up to the present and future.  Some of those slick features won’t make it because the developer doing that feature set is instead making sure the OS will run on an S9.  Others won’t make it in because the complexity required can’t be dumbed down enough for the older phones so it has to be left out entirely.   Eventually you have to ask if it’s worth it to make the sacrifices for the very small market that wants to hold onto a phone for five years.  Instead, the director says those people can either upgrade their phone or stay on the old OS because it doesn’t make sense to develop software for such a small market that isn’t paying for the software anyway.",4.0

If you are technically oriented you can search and find some Tasker scripts that will create a CSV file containing your passwords.  Otherwise you are just going to have to do it manually.My advices would be set up a password manager that is platform agnogstic and just in case you ever decide to leave it in the future allows you to export your password database.  My recomendation is [Bitwarden](https://bitwaden.com) which is free and open-source.  Then just start manually copying them in one by one starting with your most important accounts.

The S23U is more color accurate and has better zoom quality (this MIGHT also apply for the S24U with future updates). It's cheaper. It has almost the same specs in comparison to the S24U.

Both are ip68, best there is for water and dust protection (but apple's ip68 is better if you wanna dip your phone in water). Keep in mind that titanium (only found in s24u) is a much higher capacity heat transfer than aluminium so it will transfer more heat /sec to the outside as well as the inside If phones are designed anything like cars, they should be designed to withstand your area.

1cmoona,l3deiwf,bsarboukh,1715305548.0,"So I have the iPhone 14 Pro Max and primarily been with iPhone since the 4s (temporarily switched to a Windows phone around the time of the iPhone 5s but went back to it iPhone after a few months due to the HORRENDOUS batteries on the windows phone and all the replacements I received). Lately, I’m really bored with iPhone. Not to mention the amount of bugs with iOS 17 has been beyond frustrating and I’m already seeing tech vids of people that beta test the next software updates and they are saying that iOS 17.5 already has its share of bugs. I’ve highly been contemplating switching to Samsung. The Galaxy S-series to be exact. All the vids I watch on the S24 Ultra really are enticing me to make the switch. So my question(s) for all of you ex-iPhone/current-Samsung users is this: are you happy you made the switch? Was there a honeymoon phase that wore off and you wish you had stuck with iPhone? Or are you still happy with the switch and would never look back?My concerns are I’m in the States and we all know iMessage is very prominent here. I’d say about 70% of the people I message regularly are on iPhone so I can only IMAGINE the 💩 I would get if I were to switch. Now granted, I won’t be switching until the iPhone 16 comes out (my current iPhone will by paid off by then) so I have time to do more research, but I would love to hear from people who made the switch and either loved or hated their decision. My biggest concern honestly would be that I have an Apple Watch Ultra and I looo-oooo-ooove it and I know it would not be compatible with anything outside of an iPhone. I also know that most likely when iOS 18 comes out, Apple will be “playing nice” with RCS messaging making virtually everything like iMessage between iPhones and Androids with the exception of still being a green bubble. I still would love to hear from anyone and everyone who made the switch stating why they either loved or hated it. It’s silly that THIS is such a big decision but society has literally done this to our brains lol. I appreciate any and all feedback! Thanks Reddit fam!! 🙌🏻",1.0

This way you make sure you get everything. I had to download mine from icloud bc i traded in the iph to a store for credit on my new s23u and couldn't try again before closing time. I had to download everything from icloud onlineStuff wouldn't download properly bc of the size. 67 gb in totalMost of the formats were incompatible so I had to learn to run scripts on my s23u (part of the blessing I'm talking later) to mass change extentions for 2000+ itemsLost TONS of quality. I originally had 2700 items before transfer at just over 67gb. Ended up with 2850 occupying 28 gb so half the quality and no album order. Get your stuff on a PC, organize by album by putting them in folders, expect a messy time-line (some ""new"" items are in fact forgotten memes from 2015 or older)Live photos might end up as short 2-3 sec vids and it'll be a huge pain just for them alone. Idk what to do if you download them by cable in a PC. From icloud I selected most compatible format and it downloaded a jpeg and the 3 seconds movie for each live photo and then I ran a script to delete .mov files And I haven't even gotten to the best part. As a 15+ years veteran on ios and Mac and everything apple, switching to samsung has been a blessing and a curse. You will have a steep learning curve adjusting to the new ""button tap mentality"" Samsung usually has a button or a long press for what you want unlike ios where you have a gesture and sometimes maybe a button. Photos behave radically different. ios writes on the photo's metadata the belonging to an album and then for 2kb it creates an album face. On samsung it behaves just like on a PC. You move all the photo's data to a folder for completing your desired album. Wanna have the same photo in ""camera roll"" and in an album at the same time? Np, double the space occupied cus you have 2 copies of it. And down the rabbit whole with everything you have file related on your samsung. Treat it as a windows, it'll hide system files from you but can easily unhide them and can do virtually endless customization. But yeah, button based OS and behaves like a windows in more ways than oneMany people were unable to renounce their oldest habits and have eventually returned to the previously owned OS regardless where they came from so keep that in mind as well",2.0

Because one thing, you invite other entities to your white paper then you are just asking to get hacked. Why apple owns so many companies 😂 “can we collaborate with you? I think our product/software would go perfect with the apple brand.””How about we just buy your company and give you stock options on top of that, and will hand out job offers to all that want it and meet standards. Those that wish not to we will give a severance package to……” if apple wants to buy you then it’s because you did make something great that would compliment their brand. But refuse and you now have a trillion dollar company that will just reproduce what you brought forth. They’ve spent billions on research and even have gone so far as to “buy” hackers Trojans or at minimum their white paper so that they may go do what they were going to anyways just not to them bc now they have everything to counterattack. And they def don’t forget the nda with the “if you ever make another bug/malware etc towards apple again we won’t be offering you money. And we will find out if you told ur buddies who try same shit” Clause. They did that enough so far over the years rarely is there ever a threat.

But you buy apple for the sheer security and peace of mind. Knowing that your safe no matter what as long as you don’t leave ur phone unlocked in crowded place. It’s physically impossible to penetrate iCloud also. Anyone who’s ever went to college for cybersecurity knows that every single lesson taught will never have apple listed as a test subject or as an example to showcase some attack etc. and if you ask your teacher. “Why do you never mention apple in any of these case studies?” “Because there isn’t any!” It’s hard to believe and you always second guess that response.

Facetime is fab, apple pay is ahead of the game, the camera picture quality is still unbeaten and the accessory integration is unsurpassed. But actually, the iPhone is the weak link compared to the Watch and airpods pro IMO.The rest of the IOS experience is pure trash. Safari UI absolutely sucks. Apple music is clunky compared to Spotify. The lack of WhatsApp for iPad is utterly unforgivable in 2024 (not a US issue but definitely a problem for RoW), and don't even get me started on Apple Maps (still not even available in several countries).I even find the general IOS software unnecessarily complex to navigate; where android can execute something in one click or swipe, iOS needs two or three. Why, for instance, do I need a dedicated ""back"" arrow at the top left of the screen, when I should be able to swipe from the side like Android. And what the hell is going on with recent apps? Wheres the button to clear all of them in an instant??Then of course there's the subscription payment for just about every app.With Android, I can download media from any source and in any format. I can access any news sites via readily available software on the internet. I can use the phone to control my car, or I can use it to talk with other devices in my house like Sonos. It will also talk nicely to my work Window laptop (and let's face it, 90% of the professional world uses Windows). Via Phonelink, my phone can sit in my bag or pocket and I can control everything on the laptop. It's a very handy feature. On the accessory side, the Apple watch is a brilliant product and in Ultra form, it's almost everything you could ever need. The fact that I need to buy an expensive fitness app to the make the most of it, does feel like a slap in the face however. Likewise, the airpods pro are probably the best in ear buds that money can buy. But, the Garmin products are arguably better at doing what most smart watches were designed to do (track fitness). I'm not going to mention the Samsung watches, because they, like their Google counterparts, are not in the game. For the music, Sony make some extremely capable headphones and earbuds.Which means that I am drawn to use the Samsung 24U more of the time. With the S-pen, it is my do it all work phone, whilst being big enough to do all sorts of other tasks on. Its camera is great, its processor is lightning fast, the battery is fantastic and with Nova UI, the way I integrate with the phone is unlike anything I could ever hope to replicate with Apple.So, my Apple hardware will go up for sale and I'll stick with being a ""poor"" android user with my S24U and Garmin Marq2.",1.0

However, I would argue the iPhone still has some advantages even when compared to premium Android devices:1. Longer software support - iPhones typically receive iOS updates for 5-6 years, while even flagship Androids only get 2-3 years of new Android versions and security patches. Hopefully this will change with Google and Samsung promising longer support, so let's wait and see2. Tighter hardware/software integration - Since Apple makes both the hardware and software, iPhones are often more optimized and efficient compared to the fragmented Android ecosystem. This is why iPhones with less RAM often match or outperform Androids with more.3. Better app quality and earlier access - Many developers prioritize building for iOS first due to the more premium user base. So the newest apps and games often launch first on iPhone with better optimization.4. Seamless ecosystem integration - For those invested in Apple's ecosystem with Macs, iPads, Apple Watches etc, the iPhone offers unmatched continuity in areas like iMessage, AirDrop, Sidecar and more.5. Higher resale value - iPhones depreciate in value slower than Android phones, so you get more money back when upgrading.6. Privacy - If you are tech savvy you can install your own custom ROMs, but if not or just don't have the patience, iOS is better than Android for privacy. This is not to say Apple does not collect data, they do, but compared to Google they collect far less. Apple's business model relies more on selling hardware and services, while Google's core business is based on surveillance advertising which requires extensive data collection. Not to mention that if you use Android from other companies, you have Google and them monitoring your device.But both platforms are now so mature that either can be a great choice depending on one's specific needs and preferences.Just to add a small nuance, there are several 200-300 android phones that specwise are comparable with flagships.

That has absolutely nothing to do with Google's UI requirements and everything to do with the amount of Android phones in the market. Pretty much all the iPhones since the iPhone 6 have the same aspect ratio, just different screen sizes. They only release at most 4 iPhone models per year. At least 2 models will share the same hardware specifications ( eg iPhone 15/15 plus or 15pro/15pro max. different screen sizes but with the same aspect ratio). So every year Apple releases the new iPhone lineup, the developers only have to optimise their app for 2 hardware specifications shared among 4 phones.Now imagine the developers having to do the same for hundreds of Android phones from hundreds of different brands, each with totally different specifications. You would think they would give up before even trying. That's when Google steps in to at least give a basic guideline of requirements so that all the different forms of Android can handle the app properly, maybe some better than others. Hence the reason a lot of app developers only work with select phone brands to optimise their apps.

1cko7h3,l2pi0bl,einTier,1714927627.0,"Linux did it that way because of the way developers thought at the time it was being developed.  There was a real “the command line is the only real way to interact with a pc” mentality back then.  Windows and any other kind of GUI was seen as a novelty that “real geeks” didn’t have a use for.  I remember using some of the early Linux/UNIX/BSD GUIs when they were new and they were very much just a pretty front end for what was going on behind the scenes. I didn’t contribute to Linux but I knew the community and I can very much see them saying “I don’t want closing the window to close my program, the window isn’t the program!”  and “I’ll go back in the shell and close it there when I’m good and ready to.”Remember these OSes weren’t really built for desktop use, they were oriented toward servers.  You weren’t running Photoshop and a word processor and a web browser, you were running backend programs like Apache and Tomcat that wouldn’t be shut down for months or even years.  It would be tragic if you closed a window and killed your web server. Seeing how MacOS is built on BSD, it might be a programming decision made decades ago that isn’t easily overcome.  I’d never really thought about it before, thanks for sending me down this wormhole of thought.",25.0

1clfbus,l2tuwk5,medievalslut,1715003105.0,"Hi everyone! I've recently upgraded to a decent phone after only having low range for years - Samsung Galaxy S23. Very excited, very nice phone. I wasn't happy about the lack of headphone jack, but thought I could work around it like everyone else has had to. Bought an Apple USB C to 3.5mm after both Google and the sales guy assured me it would also work on a Samsung (I couldn't find a Samsung one in any of the stores). And it worked! ....for five hours, when it started only registering as a charging usb, rather than an adaptor. It started working again for a few hours the next day, but then stopped, so I figured it was faulty and returned it. The returns cashier was surprised and said they'd never had returns for that particular adaptor, so I was reassured that it was just a once off. The new adaptor worked! ... for three hours, and then the same thing happened. I tried to switch the control over in settings from the 'connected device' to 'this device', but it refused to switch every time. Tried blowing any dust out the USB C port, but honestly that shouldn't have been an issue since the phone was unpackaged literally two days ago. Restarted my device, reset to factory settings, etc, the usual drill. Nothing. I wondered if maybe it was the headphones themselves, but it still registered as charging when I unplugged them but left the adaptor in.    This has me wondering if it's an issue with a driver (...if that's the term?) on my actual phone. Given that I've had to already cash out for an adaptor and a charging adaptor (which, I must say, I was really unimpressed with. Samsung, what on earth), I'm not exactly in the mood to be flinging cash at other brands of adaptors, or my monthly grocery budget on decent Bluetooth headphones. I've seen some users talking about an app called USB Audio Player Pro and it seems like that \*might\* help, but I thought it would be worth seeing if anyone has a better idea than I do since my phone tech knowledge is limited  Thanks in advance!",1.0

It's a mid-range model that's a couple of years old, and starting to have some issues, you might want to consider an upgrade.The good news is, you could probably get a decent amount for your current phone if you sell it. And with that cash, you could treat yourself to something really nice, like the new Samsung Galaxy S23+. The battery life and camera on that thing are supposed to be awesome.Just something to think about, you know? No pressure at all.

1ck0lzj,l2po6xd,kai7895,1714929797.0,"Well it feels big. Not by it's height but by it's width. Holding my S23+ & a friend's S23U in my hands, even though it's taller, the S23U felt more comfortable to hold because of it's curved edges vs almost flat ones on the S23+. But the S23U  feels significantly heavier though.Battery life for me is excellent on the S23+. SOT is only one factor of the phone's battery performance so I don't think it's something to judge the battery out of, and it also depends on the apps we use for those on-screen tasks. SOT also depends on whether you're on data or wifi.Instead I'll share one of the good battery days I actually recorded:https://www.tumblr.com/techaudiophoto/748806142101192704/s23-battery-life?source=shareThis day was spent almost entirely outside on 5G network, with BT ON & connected to my car speakers, GPS ON & on-screen navigation with google maps, a few photos & 4k videos shot, reddit, Snapchat, some photo editing in gallery & general web browsing.Got about 8h SOT with over 21h of total runtime.  That is excellent battery back up especially given the fact that the phone was on 5G for almost all of it. If this was at home on wifi, the SOT would have been even better, but I think this depicts a more realistic busy day situation. I hope you got the idea of how good the battery life is.",1.0

S23U was only opened and tested, but I broke the display and i am very broke rn so we agreed with some firm i found to trade it for a S21 Ultra used but working and all. I have not had issues with used phones so far, ofc its also about luck. But the value is great. Instead of spending over a 1000 Euros on a ""brand new"" S23 Ultra i got it for a little more than 600.

So if you have eMMC like some $20 TV box, you might want to disable it. As long as your flash can write more than 200MB/s (even just for the first few GBs of pSLC cache), you should enable swap.

Any phone that has more than 4 GB of RAM these days is going to have a fairly easy time with nearly everything with the exception of some games. I can understand the thought of wanting to have more RAM free, but Android is based on Linux and modern Linux systems have a strong preference towards using any free RAM as cache because free RAM is wasted RAM, or in other words, if you aren't using it then it's useless to the system. Modern OSes aren't like the old days where you had to keep an eye on making sure there's always RAM free or the system will crash. Your largest stumbling block when it comes to performance and snappiness is going to be the CPU and GPU in your phone. There really is no fix for poor performance there except buying a more performant phone. I suggest you use your phone with RAM Plus on... Really push using the apps and multitasking ( Android is more robust than you think it is). Use it for a week like that. Then do the exact same thing with RAM Plus off using the phone hard for a week (again, you won't hurt anything).At the end of those two weeks you will know which RAM Plus setting is best for you and hopefully, have a better appreciation for how capable modern phones are and how far the technology has come.",1.0

I agree that samsung needs to improve the exynos still. It could be a little better. I also can agree with the fact that it's not fair for them to give one part of the world better processors, but not the other. I can even agree with the statement that ""the exynos soc is not as power efficient"". Sure. But you saying all these insane things like ""the battery will heavily degrade after 1-2 years just because it's an exynos"" or whatever else you were trying to say, I can't agree with those.

They are plenty durable as I can attest to my 10,000+ Pics and videos spanning 3 different ultra series phones. I don't own a microscope to look at any of the 5 different lenses, and really don't care to. There are obviously reasons why the manufacturer doesn't recommend or sell any case that has a screen protector over the lenses and only recommends cases with a cutout around the lenses.Here is from Samsung Official:According to Samsung's official guidelines, it is recommended to use a screen protector that is specifically designed to avoid covering the camera lenses. This is to prevent any potential interference with the camera's functionality or image quality. Samsung advises users to choose a screen protector that has a camera cutout or a hole to accommodate the camera lenses, ensuring that the protector doesn't cover or obstruct the lenses in any way: Using a screen protector with a camera cutout or a hole will help maintain the optimal performance and image quality of your Samsung device's cameras. If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to ask!These lenses are quite a bit different from the delicate special lenses used in the professional photography field as you are referring to with National Geographic. Those high end lenses would never stand up to the kind of abuse cell phone lenses go through. If you must protect the protruding lenses and don't use a case, they make specific aluminum and carbon fiber cutouts for each phone that go over the lenses and bring the edge above the lenses so the lenses don't stick out rather they will be recessed.",1.0

Reasons were explained previously.Lens and lens coatings are not any different. In fact, a $5000 pro lens has more and better protection. They aren't delicate and meant to withstand the work in the harshest environments. Even then, it's common to add lens protector, even though it affects quality and they do scratch and eventually have to be changed. it's not visible on cell phones because the lens is tiny, yet it is why it has more affect than a 6"" glass.      10K pictures and ""plenty durable"" doesn't change the fact any glass develops scratchesI am not quite understanding why we are debating something that is not really relevant. I am not forcing  you to do anything. You are welcome to use anything you wish or do not wish.I simply asked for what I personally need and explained the reason I want it based on the years of knowledge working and testing lenses.

If you're going by size then maybe consider something closer to paper size as it's easier to carry around and write with.The note taking experience is going to be identical on both. The iPad makes more sense if you have a Macbook or iPhone as it makes Apple Notes and Freeform super useful. You could still opt for programs like OneNote or Evernote, but at that point it might be better to choose based on price as both tablets will be running the same software.
