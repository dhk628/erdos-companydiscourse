Can you please share which region you're in? Asking as products can be deleted in one region, but still available in other regions. 

Island Way Sorbet seems to still be available in all West Coast regions (I checked PNW, Bay Area, Los Angeles, and San Diego).

I’m talking about the ones who REALLY milk the fact that are differently abled and act like everyone else is suppose to adapt to them only. The ones who really lean into it and seem to enjoy the fact that no one will dare call them out because they are disabled. 

The ones who will repeatedly back up their scooter a fraction of a centimeter to be able to grab the cooler door handle, so those within earshot are delighted by its repeated string of high pitched, grating beeping sounds. Only to then watch that person get up out of the chair, stand dead center in the aisle or walk themselves halfway down the aisle to grab whatever, after they just held everyone up for 5 hrs as they ever so slowly and precisely got their chair into position. 

The ones who never check to see if they might run someone over, they just roll on with no acknowledgement or apology.",1

I went to take my cart to the corral and the dude honked at me. Yes, honked... And then made a hand gesture to hurry up. Are you freaking kidding me?

846,l3u64to,onegirlwolfpack,1715601013.0,"Phthalates are not the same thing as microplastics.  Phthalates are a type of chemical that leaches into the product.  Remember bpa?  Similar issue.  There aren’t ‘chunks’ breaking off into the food.  It’s more like a bag of tea steeping in water. 

Not that the end result isn’t taking in a harmful chemical, but I felt that it was important to make the distinction.  This issue is completely separate from microplastics.  Microplastics are defined as any kind of plastic (could contain phthalates, could not) less than a certain size. 

If you removed phthalates from all plastics, the plastic would still break down over time from wind or water erosion and enter the soil, air, water, and other animals we consume.  Until plastic consumption is either greatly reduced or eliminated the microplastics issue will continue to.  Removing phthalates or bpa will not eliminate the problem. 

Removing these chemicals may make microplastics less harmful once they’re in your body but they are often replaced with alternatives that are just as bad (what happened when they started removing bpa from products).",63

Other comments indicate that the ones tested in the article (Core Power) use a different bottle, both in terms of size and material, than the 30g Nutritional Plan ones.

The Nutritional Plan ones are a #1 type plastic, which is PETE.

Some quick googling tells me that PETE doesn't have the toxic orthophthalates that leech into foods. It's also BPA free.

However, when heated and/or recycled, apparently the PETE plastic can release some toxic and/or endocrine-disrupting compounds.

On the surface, it seems that when kept at ""normal"" temperautres, PETE plastic is reasonably safe and non-leeching. It's moreso the production, recycling, and disposal that's not great.

From some additional Googling, it looks like Fairlife also uses # 7 plastic for some of their products, which at first glance seems like a more problematic category. I'm not sure if this is used on the Core Power, or their larger containers of milk, or what.

I'm not a plastics expert by any means. I think we could all stand to reduce the amount of plastics in our lifes. As to whether the 30g Fair Life drinks are an issue - it seems that they're probably not as bad as the Core Power ones? But it would take actual testing to say with any amount of certainty.",13

Only certain types of plastic contain the toxic orthophthlates that can leech into products.

It would seem that for this specific Fairlife product (we're not sure about others), they're either using a bottle or a lining that has a much higher than expected amount of phthalates.

# Plastic Chemicals in Foods: What Our Tests Found

The 67 grocery store foods and 18 fast foods CR tested are listed in order of total phthalates per serving. While there is no level that scientists have confirmed as safe, lower levels are better. Our results show that although the chemicals are widespread in our food, levels can vary dramatically even among similar products, so in some cases you may be able to use our chart to choose products with lower levels.



Includes the 10 phthalates we tested for: BBP, DBP, DiBP, DCHP, DEP, DEHP, DnHP, DMP, DiNP, and DNOP. We also tested for three chemicals used as phthalate substitutes (DEHA, DEHT, and DINCH), and three bisphenols (BPA, BPS, and BPF), which are not shown in this chart.

Phthalates main function in food packaging is to lacquer the inside of the packaging to paint a moisture seal. It is directly touching food, in its most already-a-microplastic-already-touching-food-or-liquid state.     

They aren't using polyvinyl here *with some phthalates.* They're using it directly to plasticize surfaces which touch food and drink. Think of it like microplastic paint. That's ignoring the fact that yes, if it's mostly a phthalate based plastic, it leeches into the worst microplastic form in under a year when exposed to moisture, which it is.

I would first go to the manager and ask that it be given back. If you are disciplined you should add a retaliation claim to your complaint.  Finally, as added protection, go to your manager with another employee, as this will count as ""concerted activity"" that is protected by the NLRA.

2747,l3sye5u,Captainbackbeard,1715571795.0,"As a caveat I have the Friheten sofa (not sectional) but I'd imagine they are pretty similar in comfort based on the designs Next time I'm in my store I'll check to see if they have a Coddle to see how comfy it is to sit on but I have a Friheten and as a sofa it's a bit stiff so depending on how you like your sofas it may or not work for you. Just looking at the coddle online I'd imagine it's a better couch to sit in. However, I actually love the Friheten as a sleeper sofa when you combine it with a memory foam mattress topper because the way that it swings out is pretty solid and if you get a thick enough memory foam topper you don't feel any of the cushion gaps and I think it's comparable to an actual bed (Twin XL size btw). I've had multiple guests say that it was extremely comfy (again though you'd want a memory foam topper, I have a 2.5 lb gel swirl one from mattress topper). If you have guests over fairly frequently I'd probably go Friheten but if it's more of a once in a blue moon deal and assuming the Coddle is more comfortable as a couch I'd go with it.",1

2749,l3t50vi,crosswithyou,1715575452.0,"Thanks for the info. I've sat on the Friheten at the store and it seemed fine for me. I don't like sofas that are too soft so the firmness was OK. Btw, is the bed size really twin XL? That seems kinda small? I was thinking it was closer to a queen.

I don't really foresee having guests over too often so it might be wise to get the one that's more comfortable as a couch and use a mattress topper like you suggested. I would love to try out the Coddle but I don't know if it's available at my local Costco. I'll need to check the next time I'm there, though that won't be for a while since I'm currently out of the country.

A pre-authorization confirms the account is open and reserves the funds until the order is processed or the order is canceled. Upon order shipment, Costco sends a transaction message to capture the actual amount of the order and reverse the pre-authorization. Depending on your financial institution’s timeframe for reversing or releasing pre-authorizations, the pending transaction may be removed immediately or up to the closing of your billing cycle.""

If the order never went through the pre-authorization will be reversed. As for gift cards you have to call costco.com and they can look into why the purchase never went through. Chances are your info doesn't match between the payment and your membership info or if it's a larger purchase and it's one of your first online purchases it may be flagged as possible fraud as that happens with giftcards frequently. Either way call them up and they can help",1
