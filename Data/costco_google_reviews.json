But as it continues with the questions and calling a manager twice over paying with a Visa which the company takes. We realized he was making the process harder! For no reason.. I understand they deal with plenty of people, but never was me or my husband rude. We only ask to reciprocate the energy we give. Costco is not what it used to be.",

Not only is it perpetually crowded it doesn\u2019t carry some of the items the other\u2019s do. They seem to have a culture of racial prejudice stemming from the Regional Vice President down to this club which is the only one in all of north Alabama. The employees in the store called the police on me and falsely accused me of threatening to shoot an employee after they falsely accused me of not having a membership due to what we saw was a clerical error on their behalf. When given the opportunity to apologize they instead claimed they did not tell the police that story in spite of the recorded call internal investigations has. They had me handcuffed and searched but I was released due to those false claims. The culture is toxic and the customer service is nonexistent. They\u2019re running this store like a frat house instead of a business where paying customers are respected and valued.",

The selection and savings I get at Costco are unmatched, and this trip was no different. However, after returning home, I discovered an issue with one of the produce items. Knowing I couldn't easily return to the store due to the hour-plus drive, I reached out to their customer service. The response was remarkable! The store manager was incredibly accommodating and swiftly resolved my issue to my complete satisfaction. This level of customer service is why I love shopping at Costco. I'm eagerly awaiting the opening of the new Costco in Covington later this year\u2026 more convenience coupled with the same great experience!",

      "text": "Attention anyone that shops in-store with the person they have given their secondary membership card to (husband, parent, child, etc): if your membership card is scanned at self check-out, you MUST be the one paying with your own personal card. If not, (e.g. you and your husband share the same Costco account, you scan your copy of the membership card but he pays) and the attendant notices, they will void your transaction and make you start all over again using that person\u2019s issue of the membership card. Yes, even if it is from the same account.\n\nI unfortunately found this out today while shopping with my mother for last-minute items for our family Easter party. I scanned my membership card at check out and the attendant came over to scan our larger items. I told the attendant, \u201cOh, the case of beer is my mother\u2019s,\u201d and beckoned for my mom to take out her ID so she can scan it if need be.\n\nThe employee then stopped our transaction and asked whose membership we were using. I replied that it is my membership but my mother carries the second card associated with my account. She then weirdly caught an attitude with us and told us that since the beer is my mother\u2019s, that my mother will be paying for the transaction and that we will have to start all over again after my mom scans her own issue of the card. My mother asked, \u201cEven if our cards are from the same account?\u201d And the attendant cut her off and snapped back, \u201cYES, even if the cards are from the same account, because the cards have different ending numbers!\u201d\n\nHad the attendant not been so eager to void our transaction, she would have noticed that I had already taken out my own ID for her to scan for the beer so we wouldn\u2019t have to start the check-out process over. (I had already planned on paying for all of my family\u2019s Easter groceries at the end anyway\u2026 So yes, my membership, my card, my money.)\n\nI understand that since I said the beer was my mother\u2019s, that she would have to be the one to purchase it. I also understand that it has been a busy holiday weekend and that she was probably having a stressful shift. But the attitude towards us was misplaced and voiding our transaction just to scan another card that is linked to the same account and having to start over was an overreaction. I thanked the attendant anyway as we were leaving but our interaction left a bad taste in my mouth.",

The store was absolutely spotless, clearly showing the efforts they're putting in to maintain a clean and safe shopping environment.\n\nI was in awe of how well-staffed the store was. There were plenty of employees on hand to assist with any queries or concerns, and they were all friendly and highly professional. Their willingness to help made my shopping experience significantly easier and much more enjoyable.\n\nThe staff's positive attitude and the store's cleanliness truly set this Costco location apart. It's apparent that they're not just aiming to provide an excellent shopping experience, they're also striving to create a welcoming environment for all shoppers.\n\nThis North Tulsa Costco location has set a high standard that other stores will struggle to meet. Well done, Costco, and thank you for your commitment to quality and customer satisfaction. I can't wait for my next visit!",

      "text": "Costco is a good place for shopping. This location in OKC is well stocked and clean. Most employers are friendly, but the supervisors are very rude and abrupt. Yesterday I was so disappointed, being treated like a bum by the supervisors at the front service counter. On the way check out at the door, a very young man ripped my receipt with his marker, I don't know how because the marker isn't sharp enough to poke through paper, he must yanked it hard and ripped the receipt. He asked me if I needed the receipt, yes , I need it for those items I bought for my friend.  He sent me to the service counter to have them print another receipt, the lady here took my Costco's card, went to the back office, I was in a hurry to go home after spending a long time at Costco ,  I asked her to give me back my card so I can leave, then the supervisor man came, he looked at me with a serious mean face and asked me \"WHAT DO YOU WANT? \" I wish I could record this one my phone. I couldn't believe what I heard, it is a very inappropriate way to talk to customers when it came to a problem situation. Especially he works for Costco, worldwide companies, he represented the company to serve community, other than that it's a attitude towards public for a gentleman. I don't know is it about races or anything else, but I left Costco with tears. I've noticed that several times here at this location, the supervisors never break a smile to customers, and talk very abruptly. I'm from the west coast California, I do not have this kind of problem, I don't see this kind of attitude, he's a good looking man, but he has bad attitude. Costco needs attention on their employees. I will call corporate and talk about this matter on behalf of Costco shoppers. We spend money here, we should not being treated like this. Maybe more locations needed here in OKC would help to eliminate this shameful. Maybe someone doesn't care, but I've seen reviews from other customers visited Costco had this same problem.",

Long stacks of the stick-on 1/4 ounce weights. Between 4 and 7 ounces per wheel!\n\nI gave these guys the benefit of the doubt and didn\u2019t rag on them for taking a long time. However, they do not know what they\u2019re doing. Huge let down. I\u2019ll have to bring them back to fix. Hopefully the other location can do it as I do not trust Dimond now. I foresee them telling me the soonest I can come in is 2-3 weeks.\n\nBetween the excessive time and the complete loss of confidence I have in their installation of my tires, my perception of Costco as a whole has taken a dive.\nThey\u2019ve gotta do better than this.",

However, is it really so hard to take 20 minutes to give someone a hot dog and a piece of pizza?\n\nI've also seen at least one or two employees not doing anything in the back a couple times, while my pizza started getting cold sitting there. Hire more employees or better quality employees in the food court, it's ridiculous waiting 40 minutes for a chicken bake.\n\nGreat store other than that tho",

They loaded up the truck using a forklift, then loaned us a tie down for the first trip (we had to return for a second partial pallet), and even helped tighten the load down for us! I\u2019m beyond grateful and impressed. I only wish I could thank those guys by name but I failed to take note when I was there.",

He answered all of our questions, explained the upgrade process, and showed us what our new billing would be.  Mentioned a special on a Galaxy Tablet so I purchased one.  All in all a very good visit and we upgraded to the S24+.  Would definitely recommend talking to Kyle at Verizon if you are considering an upgrade.  He also printed a return label for us.  Good that he did because the one I received in email from Verizon is not printable.",

      "text": "FOUR MONTH UPDATE: DOWNGRADE TO TWO STARS FROM FIVE\nFour months of shopping here reduces five stars to two. Terrible beef prices (go to Winco for proteins of quality and good price), rotten seafood once, moldy bagels, mis-labeled meat, lame customer service. Still useful store for things you don't eat.\n\nPREVIOUS POST\nJust joined today. Great Costco, good selection across the board. Even proteins can be reasonably priced if you look. The store guess on and on (pic.), the butcher is highly competent (pic.) of him breaking down a whole animal) - and rivals the cuts you see at Whole Foods, not Safeway or Fred Meyer's. I got a hot dog and a drink for my voyage through the aisles, and that set me back only $1.50!! (pic.). The CEO of Costco announced laspping  September at an earnings meeting that this price is \"forever\" - which is good because I spent $665+ here today (pic.) and bought 50 things, bringing my avg. cost per item $13.30.\n\nKast's Tip: Join today and spring for the Executive Membership which is twice as much as Gold ($120 vs. $60). An average couple should get around $200/year in cashback, in addition to other benefits. If you think you spend about average, or have more than two people in your home, it just makes sense!",

Must say that we stopped to get something to eat on the way out, and it was a bit of a cluster. No one working the register, and everyone standing around just jumping in trying to get to the counter in front of others who had been waiting longer. I know they're trying to encourage people to use the tablets and order that way, but not everyone wants to. They're going to have to try to figure out how to have a happy in between on that. Once we did finally break down and order that way it took longer to get our food then it did to check out with a cart full of items.",

I found some good deals like the 32\u00b0 brand shirts, in white & and black, along with some various food items that made the trip well worth it. Costco is a fantastic company that has continually put forth quality products at a discounted rate.\nThe drawback is that it's difficult to leave without overspending due to the huge selection of goods  & great discounts.\nAnother fan favorite is the in-store cafe that has items like the Chicken Bake or all beef hot  dogs\ud83c\udf2d along with various drink items that are well priced & fly out of the kitchen in volume. Costco has become an American icon, recognized as the industry leader in membership discount stores & I'll be back again and again.",

I definitely don't need gigantic boxes of cereal or massive bags of chips!! But for us I bought what I knew we could use that wouldn't be wasted!! I bought grapes, 2 pack of canola cooking oil, 12 pk. Muffins, toilet paper, minced garlic to be honest I pay that same price for a jar half that size so it was worth it..uur grand total at check out was $185. I think they have good deals but some aren't really that great!! The crowds drive me crazy there's people going every which way!! There's also no one on the floor to ask for help finding stuff!! ... that was the hardest part for me!! It's a gigantic store so u just have to go aisle by aisle til u find what you need!! I shopped here a long time ago with a friend but she knew her way around. They did have pre-made large meals like lasagna and things like that tha run between $20-$30 so in a pinch thats a good deal.and theyre roasted chickens are superb at $4.99 each and i gotto tell u its worth it because the roasted chickens at regular grocery stores are half the size!! So tast and delicious.we just purchased our first Costco card yesterday..then we went shopping...so it's good for if were going halfers with someone, or for a party,  or if you have a big family but like I Said it's just me and my husband...I don't know if it's worth all the people in the store!! To me personally it's complete insanity. In the past we have had family members order and pick us up a cake for a birthday event and they do have the best cakes with the best prices. We heard the gas was cheaper and the lines were super long but we couldn't find any signs with the gas prices...they have everything here, electronics, books, clothes, shoes, patio furniture pretty much everything u might need!! Christmas shopping will be good to do here ...Anyway thos is just my opinion.Excellent produce dept, and eggs were right under $6.00 buy I yhink it was an 18 pack or somethin",

Like I couldn't believe EVERY SINGLE CHICKEN WAS LITERALLY BLACK & BURNT, like literally black.. There was the shorter gentleman with darker, short, curly hair. And I asked if he was going to make more chickens, and he stated No they were done for the night.. There was probably a good 30 chickens sitting there just ruined and wasted & truly can't believe that Costco would allow this quality of food to be served to thier paying members, or product to be wasted like that either??!!",

We were here today a few minutes ago and wanted to buy roses that are usually fresh. However, today, all the roses were old and they had two bouquets of completely dead roses. There were two floral department employees standing right next to it talking away to each other instead of checking on all the flowers. We tried to tell them that the roses are completely dead. Instead of looking at them in detail, they argued and tried gaslight us saying that they're just brown roses. Upon further inspection, they're supposed to be a light orangish yellow color with either pink or coral. I can remove this review once they discipline the employees or do better at taking care of their floral display.",

It is also a LOT more crowded since the move out South... which is great for them, but not as a shopper. The other building needed more repairs than they were willing to do, however, so they sold it. I do like that Chic-fil-a and Starbucks are both now in the same parking lot, though! That makes it super convenient and easy. The staff at this location are mostly all nice and helpful. One woman, in particular, I can't remember her name, but she has helped me a couple of times with my special needs client when she acts out and starts screaming. She brought her stickers and sat with us. It was really above and beyond. Jenn, in customer service, is really awesome and helpful, as well!",

      "text": "A Costco is generally a Costco and a fairly good experience. I generally don\u2019t leave a 1 star review unless something is extremely bad as is the case of this Costco.\n\nThis store has extremely rude and passive aggressive employees who go out of their way to be antagonistic-especially at the front entrance. The employees are disrespectful towards the customers to an extent I\u2019ve never witnessed in any retail store, much less the Costco brand-which is known for friendlier employees.\n\nOn site management seems pretty dense on the issue and treats any complaint as \u201ctwo different sides\u201d of the customer versus the employee. What the management should be doing is holding any employees accountable for unnecessarily rude behavior and looking at reasons of why a customer would go out of their way to complain.\n\nI will be avoiding this Costco despite it being most convenient for me. If other Costcos start to become mismanaged the same way moving forward, I\u2019ll cancel my membership that I\u2019ve had for 25 years.\n\nEdit: looked at other reviews and noticed many others complaining of the same extremely rude employee behavior. The information is clearly available, yet management doesn\u2019t seem to do anything about it. Would hope to positively change my review in the future, though I won\u2019t hold my breath.",

It's very easy to navigate, though parking is getting harder to find here at times as it is getting more crowded.\n\nClean, well kept Costco with easy access off the freeway. Decent selection of products, friendly staff. Like most other stores they always seem to have holiday stuff in stock way too early (Christmas stuff after Labor day? Why, yes they do!) They're usually totally out by the time the season actually rolls around. Still, they had some cool stuff if you didn't mind the fact it was several months too early but it's mostly sold out by the time the holiday is near. The staff is helpful and the selection of products overall is still good.\n\nThe pharmacy staff is polite and helpful. I have some allergies and they always take the time to check the ingredients of every medication and make sure that it's safe for me. If the one in stock is not, they look for one that is an order that.\n\nThe tire center has great prices on tires and batteries, their prices on batteries are the cheapest in town. If a battery goes bad, they'll under the warranty and refund you the price you paid for it (or a prorated price if you're in the prorated time frame of the warranty). You only pay the difference in price if the battery has gone up in price. For tires, they will not run bigger tires than OEM or put tires on with a different speed rating, so if you're trying to run BFG KO2 tires or the like keep that in mind, as they likely won't do it. Also, they did damage the OEM wheels on a Corolla I used to own when I purchased Michelin tires from here. So keep that in mind and check your wheels before and after getting tires.\n\nNice selection of TVs at good prices. No delivery, but they've never offered delivery. The Food Court still has the same great prices it's always had. Membership is $60/year, so you get a lot of value for the price you pay.",

This is the worst Costco I've ever been to.\n\n1.) The lines are somehow always backed up\n2.) parking lot is terrible. Cramped, hard to get in and out\n3.) gas station traffic inlet and outlet is terribly planned.\n4.) there's never soft serve at the diner. May seem small, but I've never been to a Costco that's out of soft serve. It further cements that there's something stand out mediocre about this place.\n\nI'd honestly rather drive to the one in Tempe off Elliot. While further away, this one is currently a mess.",

They have a diverse variety of products! However; management for, whatever reason, will kill (discontinue) great products too quickly! If good products don't fly off the shelf in the first week of exposure, say bye, bye? If it's not a quick hit! It's deleted from the lineup! Example: Zacks jalape\u00f1o cornchips! Super flavor, nice crunch, excellent with a variety of dips! But now they're gone! They presently have a stellar green chili cheese dip that I also hope lasts w/some duration! But stay tuned for further details?",

I lived in AK and the nearest one was too far away to make it worthwhile.\nSo, as a first-time time impression, I was absolutely floored by the overall experience. I could not believe how busy it was. But everything moved along very smoothly except for the occasional person not paying attention or rude Karen's thinking that the world evolves around them. I was impressed by the shear size of the place and the fact they have everything you need in bulk. The prices were very cheap compared to the Walmart we usually go to 3h outside of the valley. I didn't attempt to go to the gas station because I refuse to wait in line for more than 5 minutes for gas. The staff was super cool and very efficient at check out. The food court is out of this world good! I chose this location because it was a convenient stop from Las Vegas as we were heading through the valley and back to Eastern Arizona. Pulling off the freeway and trying to get over to Beardsley is a little tricky. Overall, I was delighted with everything. Can't wait to make another Costco run next month!",

      "text": "In the grand realm of bulk-buy empires, where towering aisles are the skyscrapers and shopping carts the chariots of the modern age, our hero embarks on an epic quest\u2014a journey not for the faint of heart nor light of wallet. The arena of valor? None other than Costco, the colossal cathedral of consumption.\n\nOur tale begins in the dim light of dawn, with our intrepid shopper, armed with a membership card sharper than Excalibur, arriving at the gates of Costco at the hour of 8, a full thirty minutes before the battle begins. The quest was simple, or so it seemed: to venture forth and secure three sacred artifacts, items of legendary repute and uncanny value.\n\nBut, ah! The path of a hero is never straight, nor is it ever devoid of temptation. For upon the opening of the gates, a siren song of deals and discounts filled the air, leading our hero astray. The first challenge: a mountainous display of electronics, whispering sweet nothings of high definition and infinite connectivity. With a steely gaze, our hero resists... only to fall victim to a fortress of fleece blankets, softer than the clouds of Olympus and just as inviting. One magically leaps into the cart, a stowaway on the journey.\n\nThe odyssey continues, through the treacherous terrain of sample stations, where sirens with hairnets and plastic gloves offer morsels of ambrosia\u2014bite-sized temptations that ensnare our hero longer than anticipated. Each sample, a feast fit for the gods, yet leaving our protagonist yearning for more. The cart begins to fill, not with the sought-after artifacts but with goods of unspeakable delight and questionable necessity.\n\nIn the heart of the labyrinth, our hero encounters the clothing section, a realm where logic and reason battle against bargains and bulk. Here, the second cart joins the fray, summoned by the call of cargo pants that double as shorts\u2014a garment of such utility it could only be forged in the fires of convenience.\n\nAs the clock ticks, the realization dawns: the three original items, the very purpose of this quest, have eluded capture. Yet, our hero stands at the checkout, not with the modest bounty of three but with two carts brimming with the spoils of adventure\u2014a veritable treasure trove that includes everything from a kayak (for those just-in-case aquatic escapades) to a 72-pack of batteries (because one never knows).\n\nThe journey concludes, not with the triumphant acquisition of the sought-after three but with a cornucopia of unintended treasures. Our hero exits through the hallowed halls of Costco, pushing forth the chariots of plenty, a testament to the unpredictability of quests and the irresistible allure of bulk-buy bargains.\n\nThus ends the tale, a comical saga of ambition, distraction, and the universal truth that in the grand adventure of Costco, one does not simply buy what one intends. No, in this land of plenty, the carts are never half full, and the list is just a suggestion\u2014a parchment to be ignored in favor of the epic, the unexpected, and the utterly inexplicable.",

Do not like the self checkout lines but the regular checkout lanes with the cashiers move very fast. They have two people working each lane and making sure that everything is lined up get any boxes that may be needed and it moves very quickly. We also find that since they closed the the area in front of the entrance to through traffic this helps the lanes move quick when exiting not having to worry about getting hit by a car in the parking lot. The store is very clean and well stocked and the restrooms are always very clean. The automotive section associates are very helpful and help you find the exact item for your car.

Rather excessive so there goes one star for extremism. The second check was done while I was looking at food. When I started asking questions as to why, the staff immediately became defensive and honestly rather rude. There\u2019s another star. Get to the self checkout and get verified like normal currently. Then I get verified again at the actual checkout. At this point I\u2019m extremely frustrated. I start asking questions again, they act extremely rudely back as if I can\u2019t ask questions. There\u2019s another star. When I leave, the lady asks me how my experience was. I said very poor. She then informed me that the last person I dealt with has been acting the same way for a while now. Now we are down to one star. Awesome job Costco. I can see that this location has poor customer service and honestly a bit of an attitude. Must be because all of the extremely defensive employees were silver badge employees. Too much time in company to get a sharp correction or management just doesn\u2019t care.",

When I questioned the attendant, He said they had just put it out.\nI\u2019ve been repeatedly charged twice for same items. Sometimes I catch It at the store other times I don\u2019t until I get  home. Some times, the double charges were caught at the door.\nLast year I purchased a diamond ring of which was labeled 1.49 karat. But when it was all said and done, it was only 1.1 carat. I returned it which took weeks to process. This is a huge chain store so issues are bound to happen, and I completely understand, but it is happening repeatedly. Better  management is needed And better. treatment  of the public is needed. Expired food should be removed from the shelves and not forced down peoples throats.",

We've been to stores in California, Colorado, TX and others in AZ. The staff in this location is excellent and always helpful. They're always willing to help resolve any issues and have an excellent understanding of customer service. The store managers should be recognized for maintaining such a consistently positive customer experience.  As an example, yesterday I bought a pair of pants and when I got to my car, I realized they dropped out of my arms between the store and my car. I went back to the store to ask if someone turned them into lost and found. The pants were not there so the manager gave me a credit to buy a new pair.  Also, anytime I've had to return an item, there are no questions asked and they refund my purchase. I have yet to find another company that is as customer focused as Costco. My family spends an average of $12k per year at this store and we'll continue doing so as a result of their excellent service.",

It's located on Indian School Rd. and 31st Ave. Inside the Plaza del Sol area.\nThis store is mostly for commercial customers. It does have many smaller quantities items for home customers but if you look at tye pictures I posted, you will see the quantities are for restaurants and stores that buy here for resale. The isles are almost double the size since most customers here are using the flat bed carts to shop. They do have multiple registers open and moving faster than other Costco stores, so waiting in line was not an issue.\nThe store it's about the size of two regular Costco with massive walk-in freezer for meats, dairy, and other cold temperature products.",

      "text": "Papers please!  That would be, how I describe the place in two words. You sign up, become a member, pay your yearly fee and it used to just be that you show your card at the door, but now they want you to show your card at the door, show to a extra person at self check out Who has nothing to do with the checkout process ( which is the only way to quickly get through check out because they don\u2019t have many registers open anymore) and of course, stand in a line, sometimes quite long so they can look at your receipt. Overall, the place makes you feel like a criminal just for shopping there. Selection is pretty good and the prices are OK, not amazing. I find it annoying that the only interaction you have with employees is to check your papers and if you actually are looking for one to try and help find something, it\u2019s difficult to find one. When I asked why they have so many checkpoints I\u2019m given the generic response that they\u2019re worried about other people using someone\u2019s card. Yet if they were that worried, perhaps they should implement a different system, or better yet open more registers.",

The Hispanic gentleman was the only one assisting a customer- and as soon as he was done with them, he came over, apologized for the wait, and helped us.

This location is very convenient for me and I\u2019ve been here too many times lol.\n\nWhat can I say, Costco always carry new unique things for sale and today, I found a beautiful succulent arrangement for $19.99! I also found a box of 8 crispy potato corn dogs on sale for $7.69! Regular price is $10.69 so it\u2019s a great deal. It\u2019s an item I\u2019ve never seen before but another shopper said it\u2019s so good so of course I had to get a bag. Their regular prices are very good , but when they have sakes, prices can\u2019t be beat.\n\nToday, they also had a couple events going on- jewelry and Candy & Chocolate Coz dipped apples- 3 of them for $13.99 which is a great price.\n\nThis store is always busy but today seemed busier than usual. I could not believe I scored 2 free huge protein bars at one of the sample stations. They sell for )4 each. How can I not love Costco? :)",

The selection of products is amazing, covering everything you could need and more. However, be quick with new items as they tend to sell out fast!

      "text": "Costco has gone down hill! If I could give it zero stars I would. My partner and I pay the fees, renew and maintain the memberships, and frequent the stores. Everyone knows the boycott situation with Walmart due to the receipt police after self check out. But nobody talks about the insane helicopter Costco employees by the check out and even throughout the store. I understand showing your membership card for entry. You have to verify that I'm a member before entry\u2026 that\u2019s totally okay. I understand checking the receipt upon exiting to make sure the item count is correct\u2026 I completely understand.\nBut I was asked to show my membership card again while shopping in the clothes. Again while standing in the self checkout line. Again when we got to the kiosk.\nA woman walked up and grabbed the scan gun to start scanning my items. I said nothing but Once she saw my face she stepped back as if to allow me to continue. She never put the scan gun back for customer use so I then had to take all the groceries out of the cart then scan and put them on the scale and then back in the cart.(considering it\u2019s self check out shouldn\u2019t the customer be able to use the scan gun to scan my own items? If I wanted an associate to scan them I would go to a line with a cashier).  She then stood there and stared at me to insure I didn\u2019t skip scanning any items. (Isn\u2019t that why they check the receipt at the door?) (if the concern was theft, why did Costco implement self checkout?)\n\nPreviously, I asked the associate who verified my membership \u201cis there a reason they check for memberships after entry and prior to check out?\u201d\nShe said absolutely there is\u2026 it\u2019s to ensure other family members are not using the membership because when they do prices go up. Her example was they don\u2019t want daughters using mom\u2019s membership. I understand they believe it will stop daughter from using moms membership when moms not there. Realistically this doesn\u2019t change anything, whether mom is present with daughter or daughter shops alone with moms card\u2026 daughter still will not have membership and shop and the groceries will go home with whoever.\nChecking memberships over and over is not going to stop family members from using others memberships\u2026. It\u2019s only going to upset other customers and derive them from shopping here. Just it did with us today.",

I bring my kids here often for pizza and hotdogs and not only is it the most affordable way to feed kids in town, it is fast too. They keep the tables clean and the napkins, straws, and condiments are always stocked. If you call ahead and order your pizza, they usually have it ready in less than 15 minutes. You can also grind your coffee beans in the food court area while you wait",

The staff consistently impresses with their friendly and attentive service, ensuring a positive shopping experience. While most employees excel in customer service, there's room for improvement with the demeanor of the older cleaning lady at the food court. Nevertheless, the store maintains exceptional cleanliness and organization throughout. Despite the crowd, the food court operates efficiently, minimizing wait times. A special touch comes from the receipt checkers who consistently draw happy faces for my kids, bringing joy to their shopping trip. Costco remains a top choice for our family, offering not just quality products but also memorable experiences that keep us coming back week after week.",

I saw customers just throwing the shirt or pair of pants back on the pile without any care of consideration. My heart goes out to the employees who have to pick up after messy customers.\n\nI ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza, vanilla ice cream, and a soda from the food court. They were very busy, but received my order within 2 minutes. It was also a very cheap meal.\n\nI highly recommend this location to anyone who loves to shop in bulk.

I called there today at the last minute, thought to check on car battery prices, and found that they had the best price with the best warranty. When I 1st got on the phone with Nick, there was a bad connection, and he offered to call me back, fixing that connection. I took the old battery to Costco, he was actually at the cash register, took care of getting me the new battery, and was genuinely friendly. Way to go, Costco Nick is a definite asset to your company, and I feel like he went above and beyond what was expected.  I will definitely be purchasing all future auto batteries from Costco!",

This store feels like (I haven't checked) a bigger than normal store and the parking lot can feel overwhelming.\nOnce we got inside of this megalopolis of a store, it almost felt like we were still social distancing.\nThe isles are wide and there was plenty of room for shopping, socializing, and sometimes just parking your cart in the middle of an intersection to ponder life....\nThe checkout was fast and the store was clean; the workers were friendly and jovial, not a word I use carelessly.

Unfortunately the closest Costco is in Tucson.\nI used to like going to Costco, I like to take my time shopping and browse through the isles, that's when I lived in Denver. The Costco in the River Point shopping center was really nice,clean and not a nightmare zoo like the Costco in Tucson. I actually hate shopping at Costco now, there are so many people you can barely move around, it doesn't matter what day or time, parking is a nightmare. I run in and grab what I need and since I'm in such a hurry to get OUT of there I usually forget something. Very disappointing.. that's my opinion.",

I bought strawberries and nectarines at a good price and was really excited to try them at home only to find that the strawberries in the middle were really spoiled and one of the nectarine had a developing mold. LIKE WHAT. I never had strawberries from Sam\u2019s Club turn out bad so it was a real disappointment when not one but TWO Costco produce items turned out to be really bad. Had to throw away like one fourth of the strawberries :((",

I buy electrical appliances and furniture because I trust them and they help the customer a lot in the event of a return or if the goods are defective. In my last visit, I was not able to shop. To be honest, the prices are very high. I feel that I need to offer  A loan from the bank so that I can buy food. Meat, fish, chicken...everything is expensive. The quantity may be larger than in some stores, but I need $300 to buy a piece of fish, meat, and chicken!!!  Imagine...as there are some items that carry their Costco logo, their prices seem lower than other  prices. I was walking around and I was under the influence of shock. If I wanted to buy vegetables, meat, and bread, as I said, I will apply for a loan...I love Costco. Please be considerate.  People come to you from far away places.. so that you can find competitive prices and good goods.. also the price is important. We are not rich, we are just employees who take our wages by the hour. Imagine that I work a whole day for a piece of meat, and maybe I need to work for two days.....\u2639\ufe0f",

Solomon made me feel discriminated against and like a petty thief.\n\nI visited the standalone Savvy Cie Jewels section today to purchase jewelry for my wife as a Mother's Day gift. After selecting the items, I received a ticket to take to the cashier to be paid for. I proceeded to pay for the jewelry along with three other items. Cashier said I have to go back to pick up my paid items so I did. I exited the store, and returned to collect my purchased items.\n\nAs I re-entered, Solomon the greeter hesitantly ask me what am I doing? I explained, I came back to pick up my paid items he unpolitely told me to placed my shopping cart at the entrance which I did. Being very bothered by his attitude, I proceeded to pick up my purchased Savvy Jewelry.After picking up my items I headed towards the exit to retrieve my shopping cart, Solomon questioned my actions again(I felt a little harassed). I patiently reiterated, that I was simply there to collect the jewelry I had already paid for. To support my explanation, I displayed my receipts and the two purple jewelry bags, which are only given to customers who have shown their paid receipts to Savvy representatives. He insisted on seeing my receipt again. I showed him my paid receipts. Despite presenting my receipts and the two purple bags containing my merchandise, Solomon continued to detain me, causing me to be late for an appointment.\n\nHe insisted on searching my bags multiple times, causing a further delay and more frustration. Even after I requested to leave due to my appointment, he refused, stating he was just doing his job.\n\nI felt extremely unjustly treated and discriminated against. Solomon's behavior was unacceptable, especially considering him detaining me for such a long time. I have never experienced such disrespect and disappointment at Costco before.\n\nSolomon's lack of customer service skills, rudeness, discriminative and not paying attention to details on my receipts were evident. He urgently needs retraining. I hope management take the necessary actions on Solomon poor service skills so that this awful experience wont happen again to another customer. If it weren't for my 20 years of membership, I would never return to Costco after this incident.",

I have had the time to speak with many other customers with similar absurd wait times. I was there yesterday and one of the employees told me it would take about an hour to have my tires inspected and plugged. I went and ate dinner nearby, got coffee, and ended up having to wait another two hours. I saw cars with appointments much later than mine get pulled into the bay while mine was still not done. My complaint is not about the employees. The staff is pleasant and you can see them working, but management needs to do better. Why have so many appointment times available if every day they are backed up by hours? Why not give a more accurate time estimate so folks can adjust? Many customers came to the desk to ask a question or buy a battery, but there is no on there to help them. The free services offers if you buy your tires at Costco is great, but the reality is that you might be better off going somewhere else and paying if you value your time and consideration.",

It's a great way to save money on high-quality items.  The Owings Mills location is always clean and well-organized, and the staff is friendly and helpful.\n\nHere are some of the things I like most about this Costco:\n\nHuge variety: No matter what you're looking for, you're likely to find it at Costco. They have a great selection of brand-name products at warehouse prices.\nBulk savings: Buying in bulk is a great way to save money on household essentials.\nFriendly staff: The staff at Costco is always helpful and knowledgeable.\nClean and organized store: The store is always clean and well-organized, making it easy to find what you're looking for.\nOverall, I highly recommend shopping at the Costco in Owings Mills. It's a great place to find everything you need for your home at a great price.",

      "text": "Costco is the most annoying warehouse store on the planet, I don't care which location, they all just kind of suck. They don't let you in if you aren't a member, so even if you want to see the prices and items to see if it's worth it to join, you have to go with someone who is a member just to get in the door. They don't take Mastercard, so make sure you have a Visa or cash when you go. If you bring a friend, you'll probably have to pay for them on your same card and split the bill later.\nI literally only joined for two specific items that I'd found out they carry like a week before, but because you can't look through the store before you are a member and they don't have guest passes, the day I joined they were out of both things. It was such a schlep to the middle of nowhere just to find out the membership I paid for was pointless.  I tried to order the items through their website and the product information didn't even show up as items they sell, even if they were out of stock, so I thought they were discontinued.\nThe parking lot at this location in particular is kind of a nightmare because there's basically two lots with a through-lane dividing them and people with their oversized carts just walk willy nilly in front of moving vehicles.\nThe prices on some of the items are decent enough, but we'll see if my membership actually pays for itself with the five items I get from there.\nIn comparison, BJ's lets you in even if you're not a member, and you can pay with both Visa and Mastercard. BJ's also has curbside pickup and ordering from their website reflects the products actually available in their store. The Owings Mills and Hunt Valley locations also have only one parking lot so traffic isn't as crazy.\nThe main difference between BJ's and Costco would be the inventory. Most of it's comparable, but there are things you can only get at one and not the other (which is why I got the Costco one despite them being like nazis about their stores) and sometimes the prices are significantly better at one or the other, but it's a product by product basis. I've never had a Sam's club membership so I don't know how that would compare.",

Maybe they just injected water to increase the weight. Maybe it was something besides water.\nI decided do not buy  meat at this Costco anymore.\nThis rating is only for this, meat department. I do not have any complaints about others. Everything is always clean and tidy.  Large assortment of goods. Convenient parking lot, fast and polite staff.\nEven during busy days and holidays we do not spend to much time to pay for the purchase.\nI also used delivery from Costco - perfect and fast service.

There was no sinage or person to tell me there may not be a return policy on the 900 dollar computer I just bought.\n\nNow at this point I'm realizing no one knows what a warranty is. I might be using old retail terminology, but as someone who recently left a position of management even I know that a warranty is the same as a protection plan. So at this point I'm done. The only person who seemed to know what I was talking about walked into the conversation just as I was leaving it. Nice guy, but it was too late. I walked away.\n\nteach your team to ask the right questions, or have the right answers. You know, the answers I later found out were on the receipt. a simple, \"The phone number to call for a protection plan is on the receipt,\" because apparently I can't buy that while I'm in store.\n\nNEVER.

I figured they added some kind of sauce when they served them as samples but I had no clue what it was. I called the store thinking it would be a long shot but Michelle answered, told me she\u2019d call back and she did. She actually checked on the sauce name and followed up like she promised. I missed her call but she followed up with me the next day to make sure I knew the name of the sauce, literally amazingggggggg customer service. Thank you so much for going out your way to help me!!",

Besides getting our food and paper goods here they also have a good selection of clothing, electronics and gifts. Honestly they have pretty much anything a household or business would need. Including furniture, cleaning supplies and equipment, health and beauty aids, holiday decorations and food. It goes on and on. I recently purchased a 9600 watt, 3 fuel (gas, propane and natural gas) generator from here. I\u2019ve seen this generator online for $1000.00 or more. They had it for $700.00. Works great. You have to buy a membership. I recommend buying the basic membership at first. It\u2019s $60 for the year. If you  decide you like it and are going to go frequently you can upgrade the membership at anytime and save even more money and get more perks.",

      "text": "I want to tell you first of all that I love Costco but I had a very bad experience last week. 3 months ago we had purchased four pairs of eyewear. Recently I had a problem with one pair where the screw came out and I dropped them. I went back to Costco to get a repair. When I approached the optical center there were three people standing there with no customers I jokingly said to the person who approached me oh you must have drawn the Short straw. Because I had a problem I said here's the problem and show them to her she looked up the glasses saw that I had purchased them recently and check the ID number on the frame she then told me I can't do anything with this you have to buy a new frame I said but it only needs a screw. She didn't say that would not work and she doesn't know what screw it needs. I asked her if she would just try. She told me you understand this when you buy the glasses there is no warranty. Again repeating it only needs a screw. Why don't you just try she said no I can't do that! I suggested she take the screw out the other side and then she would know what it needed. She said it doesn't work that way. I asked  her again, can't you just try she repeat it know you need to buy new frames. At that point I was pretty upset and I said give me my glasses I'm getting out of here. I went to customer service and spoke to the manager. He explained that they are really not Costco's glasses it's a separate business and there's nothing that he could do about that. He was polite and understood my problem. Just to mention the eyeglass case that they gave me says Kirkland and the cleaning cloth that comes in the case that says Costco. My insurance company said that they have arrangements with Costco for glasses. The person in optical simply did not want to do anything and there was no one else there she had nothing else to do. I got a $1 eyeglass repair kit at the dollar store they gave you an assortment of screws I tried two, the third one fit. I put the lens back in tighten it down and it works perfectly. I was able to do that in about 10 to 15 minutes and I am not a person that works in an optical department. I cannot express how very disappointed I am in the way I was treated at the Costco store which is on veterans highway in Warminster, Pa.\nJust to mention I also purchased hearing aids at that store, that department is also an outside franchise. But the people in that department treat you with respect and are very helpful in any need. Someone needs to talk to those people in the optical department in Warminster on Veterans highway.",

So, I immediately drove over to Costco (Glen Mills) with the intention of replacing my tires. After the Costco technician inspected my tires, he told me that my tires measured 7/32 inches and said that I didn\u2019t need new tires. I was thankful that the Costco technician was being honest. That is why I\u2019m a loyal Costco member. I\u2019m impressed with Costco\u2019s honesty and integrity. Bottom line? If you are told that you need tires, go to Costco for a 2nd opinion.",

From the moment I stepped in, I was greeted by a variety of high-quality products ranging from groceries to electronics, all at incredibly reasonable prices.\n\nThe store was immaculately clean, and the aisles were well-organized, making it easy to find exactly what I needed. The staff at Costco were exceptionally friendly and helpful, always ready to assist with a smile. Whether I had a question about a product or needed help locating an item, they were there to help without hesitation.\n\nOne of the highlights of my visit was the food section. The fresh produce was vibrant and abundant, and the bakery items were irresistible. I also appreciated the wide selection of organic and health-conscious options available.\n\nAnother aspect of Costco that impressed me was their commitment to customer satisfaction. The return policy is generous, giving me confidence in my purchases. the checkout process can be slow however I used the self checkout which was efficient \u2013 a real time-saver during busy shopping trips.\n\nOverall, Costco offers a superior shopping experience that combines quality, variety, and value. It\u2019s a one-stop-shop for everything you need, backed by excellent customer service. I\u2019m already looking forward to my next visit!",

      "text": "This is the best Costco I\u2019ve been to hands down. I had found a really great coat in my town that was a GREAT price. Well, the coat ended up being too big. Went to another location to see if they had my size, which they did, but the manager said \u201cthere\u2019s no way in hell I can honor that other price.\u201d What manager talks to a customer like that? Finally drove out to this one in Lancaster (i really wanted this coat). Linda, in clothing, would not give up til she found my size. However my size ended up being in a big box above the cereal aisle. The manager Glenn could not get it down for me in that moment, but got it down for me the next day, called me to let me know, put it on hold til I could come grab it AND honored the price I originally paid. THANK YOU LINDA AND GLEN! You guys went above and beyond and it didn\u2019t go unnoticed.",

      "text": "I wish there was an option for Zero Stars!! Everytime my wife and I go to this particular Costco we have an issue. Lines are always long, and store associates are always rude and not helpful. Today was the last straw for us shopping at this particular Costco in Lancaster, PA. Most likely when our membership expires we will spend the extra time and money traveling to our closest Sam's Club which is an extra 20 minutes where our shopping experience is appreciated. Back to my experience today...\nAs my wife and I were placing our items on the belt to pay for them I pulled out my phone (because it is 2024 and there is an app for everything) and showed the cashier the membership card QR code to scan. She then asked if I was on the account and I stated I don't believe so and she said I will need to see your membership card. I then said I don't have a separate one and she continued scanning our items no big deal. I then still had my phone out and decided I would tap to pay with my phone. As I tapped with my phone to pay with my wife's debit card, the cashier then stated to me that I am not allowed to pay unless I showed her my Costco membership card. I said it is my wife's debit card and she said it doesn't matter, my wife had to pay. So you mean to tell me my wife has to tap my phone? What difference does it make who swipes card or taps a phone to pay? They are still getting paid. I realize policies are policies but this is a pretty dumb one and it's not like my wife wasn't with me, she was standing right next to me. If that is the policy the cashier could have been a bit nicer to explain the policy since I am the paying customer. She also could have mentioned this when scanning my membership card and realized I was not the card holder before she wastes my time and scanned all my groceries.",

      "text": "Costco has consistently exceeded my expectations and earned its reputation as a top-notch shopping destination. From the moment you step into the warehouse, the friendly and helpful staff create a welcoming atmosphere.\n\nThe membership perks are truly exceptional, offering access to high-quality products at unbeatable prices. The diverse range of items, from groceries to electronics, ensures that you can find everything you need under one roof. The bulk packaging not only saves money but also reduces the need for frequent trips to the store.\n\nCostco's commitment to quality is evident in its selection of fresh produce, meats, and bakery items. The Kirkland Signature brand, in particular, stands out for its excellent value and reliability. I appreciate the emphasis on organic and sustainable options, catering to a variety of preferences and dietary needs.\n\nThe tire and automotive services have been a lifesaver, providing professional and efficient assistance. The gas station, with its consistently competitive prices, is an added bonus for members.\n\nThe seamless online shopping experience through Costco's website and app makes it convenient to browse and order products from the comfort of home. The delivery services are prompt and reliable, ensuring that you receive your items in excellent condition.\n\nOverall, Costco's dedication to customer satisfaction, unbeatable prices, and a wide array of high-quality products make it a shopping experience that consistently earns a five-star rating. I highly recommend Costco to anyone seeking value, variety, and exceptional service.",

I\u2019m not digging it out while I am navigating the line    we\u2019re like no we need to see it now.  What an inconvenience we are in a long line as in and now all of us had to dig out our cards before we were even at the checkout and they were rude about it too.  Then they were hovering over everyone checking everything you scan.  I have never had this experience anywhere. I run and own my own business and we had my parents with us in wheel chairs and had to hold up the line for the cards with wheel chairs and carts and then again so they could push past my parents to watch us all scan our groceries and my sister who lives locally said she stopped coming because they act like that everytime she has come lately. I told her that\u2019s why I love Sam\u2019s club because you can scan/go and just checkout at the exit.  They don\u2019t act like you\u2019re a criminal. Which is insane.

It's supreme, but thank god they left off the olives. Pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, zucchini, red/orange/yellow peppers. *chefs kiss* thank you costco for continuing to consider those of us with celiac or who can't have gluten.

I wish they had diesel.\n\nCheck the website to see when specific vendors will be there.\n\nEmployees are VERY friendly & try to go above & beyond to help. Hit up the food court on your way out - who can beat a soda & hot dog for $1.50?!\n\nAnnual membership is $60 & pays for itself! Shopping in bulk for a family of 5 comes in handy!\n\nVisit between noon & 3 - you can sample all types of foods for free.\n\nI used to love their pepperoni pizza. Unfortunately, I've been diagnosed with celiac disease & can't enjoy it anymore. I wish they offered a gluten free pizza without cross contamination.\n\nCostco has dozens of gluten free options in general. Fresh, refrigerated, frozen, canned, etc, there are many official gluten free certified options. Impressed with the amount of protein shakes in bulk.\n\nFor days I'm crippled & cannot walk, there's always a motor scooter available! \ud83d\udc9c1 wet",

      "text": "As a Costco member since day one at Little Rock, I've sadly observed a noticeable decline in the level of customer service and overall shopping experience. Previously, the staff were exceptionally friendly and attentive, with individuals guiding customers to the shortest checkout lines, assisting with loading groceries, offering carry boxes, and greeting with warm smiles. However, this has changed over time, which I understand can happen in many establishments as they mature. With the introduction of self-checkout lines, I found it convenient and didn't need to rely on cashiers as much.\n\nYet, when employees were assigned to the self-checkout lanes, one would assume they'd be there to assist with scanning items, given their access to barcode scanners. However, this wasn't the case. I encountered a situation where a staff member declined my request for help scanning two king-size pillows, citing them as \"small items,\" despite it likely taking mere seconds. Meanwhile, I observed her colleagues assisting customers with scanning smaller items like boxes of strawberries. It appeared that their willingness to assist depended on their mood, which was disappointing. While I don't mind if they opt not to help if they could let the customers \u201cself\u201dcheckout, unfortunately they also tend to linger and monitor the checkout process, seemingly scrutinizing customers until they deem someone \u201cworthy\u201d of their assistance.\n\nThe two stars are for selling the quality items and the kind senior lady at the entry always welcoming people with smiles.",

It looks like they are going to do a full renovation, but time will tell. I'll update when it reopens if I remember. : )\n\nI don't go there on the weekend if possible. It's incredibly busy and the lines for checkout sometimes reach the back of the store. That said they do do a very good job at getting people through the checkout lanes once you get to the register.\n\nI would definitely avoid this location near the holidays if possible as you will be trapped in the shopping center for a good 10 to 15 minutes at best trying to get back out to the main road. I have been stuck in the traffic for nearly a half hour in the past.\n\nOther than that it's a good store.\n\nI wish they had a Costco gas station here. That would be a really nice addition. I go to Revere or Stoneham a lot instead of here because they have gas stations at their locations.",

Amazing how Costco keeps up with growing membership without compromising service and diversity of products.

Given that even non-members can come avail the Food Court,   they could consider relocating the Food Court ( like the tire center in some locations) away from the warehouse.

She was exceptionally friendly, helpful, and made my checkout process smooth and pleasant. Her professionalism was truly appreciated.\n\nHowever, there were some aspects of my visit that left me feeling disappointed. Despite having already scanned my membership card during checkout, I was approached by another staff member who asked to see my membership again. This redundancy felt unnecessary and somewhat frustrating, especially since I had already completed my transaction.\n\nAdditionally, I encountered a staff member during the final checkout process who seemed dismissive and unhelpful. When I questioned a procedure, his response was curt and bordered on rude. It would have been more helpful if he had taken the time to explain any new policies rather than dismissing my concerns.\n\nFood court:\nFurthermore, while I understand the cashier\u2019s need to count money, a simple acknowledgment of our presence and assurance that she would assist us shortly would have been appreciated.\n\nLastly, I want to acknowledge the positive interaction I had with William. Despite our frustration and hunger, he remained calm, attentive, and ultimately assisted us with getting our food. His kindness and understanding were a welcome contrast to the challenges we faced earlier in our visit.\n\nIn conclusion, while there were highlights during my trip to Costco, such as the excellent service from Anna L. and William\u2019s kindness, there were also moments of frustration and disappointment. I hope this feedback helps Costco improve their customer service and ensure that all customers feel valued and respected throughout their shopping experience.",

What I mean is if I need just a carton of milk it comes in a pack of three. But the price is right. Costco always has great holiday items.\n\nCostumer service is ok. I rarely need to ask for help.

So, using their electric mobility shopping carts helps us to get around these warehouse-sized stores more easily. Also, the folks who work here are always friendly and helpful. Their customer service is amazing as well. The only thing that I hope Costco would do is for shoppers with a smaller household i.e. (who are single or have a two-person family) is to also have perishable food items that come in smaller portioned packaging. Since we live in a small apartment, our storage space is minimal and our refrigerator doesn't have a large freezer.",

There was a female associate yelling at customers and herding them like cattle toward the other end of the store. She had the most miserable look on her face and was irritated whenever anyone asked her anything. It was incredibly rude, vulgar, and unprofessional. When I finally got to the register, the man ringing me up didn't even acknowledge my existence. He rang up 4 items before I said \"hello how are you?\" It was at that point that he even looked at me. He was literally looking past me and over my head prior to that. I am absolutely shocked at what is acceptable as an employee in 2024. I mean, you are getting PAID to do a JOB. You are not doing anyone a FAVOR by going to work, and people going into an establishment expect BASIC and COMMON courtesy. It's one thing when you encounter a single rude employee, but it's entirely a different experience when it seems like there is just absolutely no standard for service there anymore. I'll drive all the way to concord to have a pleasant experience and not leave an establishment feeling drained and brought down while spending a large amount of money. This was my third poor experience in 2 weeks. Done!",

It's as if they stock every conceivable item, each more tempting than the last with unbeatable deals. Just today, I went over my shopping list by 20 items, each one as necessary as the last, and I couldn't have been happier to indulge. The cherry on top? Exiting the store with a $1.50 hot dog and a generously sized soda in hand. In what other place can you find such a steal? Naturally, I doubled my order. Spending a mere $3 on two hearty beef hot dogs and two sodas seemed like the bargain of a lifetime. Costco is the ultimate destination for those who seek incredible savings on bulk purchases, from essential groceries like chicken breasts and beverages to anything else you might need.",

At other Costco's it\u2019s common to offer towels when it\u2019s raining since they don\u2019t store any carts inside, which I understand why. I\u2019m disappointed with the customer service, frustrated my son\u2019s clothes got wet and disappointed if Costco suddenly stopped offering towels to dry off carts (not only for kids but so you don\u2019t have to put items in a wet cart).",

      "text": "Costco is one of the better \"big stores\" in Chico, IMHO. Their gas station is well organized; even though it's always packed, it doesn't take that long to make your way through. And it's always packed because oftentimes they have the best gas prices in town.\n\nTheir eye-glasses department I feel is the best in Chico. They have the absolute lowest prices for frames/lenses versus everywhere else I've experienced. They also have a wide selection of frames for men, which has been an issue for me at other places in the past. Not only that, they took my eye insurance with no problems and I had my new glasses in just 2 weeks.\n\nThen for everything else they sell in the store, they have a nice big variety of items to choose from and their prices are normally lower than other stores. It just depends if you want to buy in bulk or not. Its become one of my family's \"go to\" stores that we visit at least once a month.\n\nCostco also sells a lot of seasonal, non-grocery, related items too and their selection is always changing (the whole middle section of the store). These items always get me into trouble because it's often stuff that I like a lot but they're usually bigger items. So, my wife tries to steer me away from the middle section of the store once she sees me wandering that way, lol.\n\nThe last thing I wanted to mention is their food court. You can basically get lunch for pretty darn cheap, and it's usually pretty good. I know some people come here regularly just to visit the food court area. However, if the lines are really long - I tend to skip on the food court because it can get super crowded with people/carts and the lines can get unwieldy.",

The store has a larger variety of items compared to Sam's. Prices are also lower on most items. The upside to Costco in ny opinion is the lower prices, better quality items, shorter lines, later evening hours, convenience of an optical center, tire center, low gas prices, and  curbside pickup. However the down side in my opinion is the lack of their app services such as no \"scan as you go\"  type of shopping available, no cash back rewards unless you have their credit card, many items are shipping only, the member service desk at this location is a tad to hectic, unorganized, and very confusing for any new memeber trying to navigate what to do next. Nevertheless, I'd still definitely recommend this Costco to anyone and gave it 5 stars because the cons are all minor, and it may have just been one of those hectic days for me.  All together I honestly can't complain and I'll Def be back.",

Today my wife had an appointment to get a prescription for contact lenses, when we arrived we were told that we had an appointment to get a prescription for glasses. The manager is absolutely not interested in resolving the issue and did not want to help us, claiming that the appointment was made for a prescription for glasses. When we made the appointment a few days ago, we said several times that we needed a prescription for contact lenses and discussed the price!!! The manager entered incorrect information into the database and this service was not provided to us today. As a result, we lost a working day and traveled a long distance without results.",

The piece of furniture was the last one on the floor and he kindly searched for other locations for availability. Answered all of my questions and even put my items at the front for me to arrange pick up. I am very satisfied with his service. He definitely went the extra mile assisting with my requests.

Concord is becoming more and more ghetto which means you will have people in lifted trucks aggressively tailgating you and swerving around you to snag a parking spot.

Every-time I come to this location I\u2019m questioned for 10 minutes about my service dog to the point I can\u2019t even bring him to this store anymore because I start shaking like crazy because I\u2019m surrounded by workers asking questions. He is fully trained and fully tasked. But today I went in. There was not one, not two, but THREE small dogs in the store when the sign says service dogs ONLY. These small dogs are clearly not service dogs. The one Chihuahua was being physically carried by its owner, the other one was shaking so much because it was terrified, and the last one was in a stroller. Im so sick of paying for a membership where I\u2019m questioned every time I come in by multiple employees. Yes they have the legal right to ask. But EVERY SINGLE WORKER when I had already been standing there 10 minutes and had already answered the question multiple times is absolutely ridiculous. So because I bring my big breed dog in he\u2019s not allowed because he\u2019s a large breed. But a Chihuahua barking all over the stories allowed in. I\u2019m done paying for a membership with this place. It isn\u2019t even worth it. Educate your staff.",

Despite the overwhelming rush of customers which is a common spectacle, the staff impresses with their excellent management and efficient handling of the crowd. They perform their duties with a professionalism that truly embodies the spirit of Costco.\n\nParking can occasionally be a bit of a challenge due to the high traffic volume, but this is a small inconvenience in light of the overall shopping experience. The in-store amenities are numerous, and the pharmacy stands out particularly. The pharmacy technician, Jenn, demonstrates stellar service, embodying an upbeat, positive demeanor that brightens your day. She rectified a price error on one of my medications with such swift grace, it seemed effortless.\n\nThe snack bar is also a buzzing hub within the store, constantly busy serving up their delectable treats. A suggestion for improvement would be the incorporation of kiosk ordering at the snack bar, similar to other Costco locations, to streamline the process and better serve the high customer volume.\n\nThis Costco location delivers an exceptional shopping experience, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone in the Cypress area. Their staff, especially the likes of Jenn at the pharmacy, and their wide range of products never fail to impress. The busy nature of the store is a testament to its popularity and the value it provides to the community.",

He was very unprofessional and his demeanor was threatening. I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s having a bad day or what but this is not the customer experience that Costco has been known for. Now if he had asked me to move, I wouldn\u2019t be writing this 1 star review. \u201cfrank\u201d needs to be re-trained on his customer service skills. \u201cI\u2019m telling you! You need to move!\u201d as he walked away towards the kiosks/counter area.",

      "text": "I still brought my daughter shopping this Sunday, but this time I was treated very unfairly. After I paid my bill, I waited in line at the membership counter with my little girl in her shopping cart, ready to ask about the less than $60 cashback on last year's EXCLUSIVE card. (I saw a share on the social media platform that users with an EXCLUSIVE card that costs $120 a year can either downgrade to the $60 adult gold card or refund the difference. So I also want to know if the consultation is true). There was a middle-aged white lady and a man in front of the queue. The middle-aged white lady was soon served by someone with a good attitude and chatted for at least 40 minutes. But the man in front of me and I were not so lucky, we waited for half an hour, still no one, inexplicably there are four counters, standing about 5 male and 3 female staff, they did not even politely tell us to wait a little bit, they were just there to laugh and chat! The work attitude is not serious, not responsible, very perfunctory, I doubt Costco's staff training and enterprise spirit, what is the value? It was really a long wait, my daughter was a little difficult, but I was still calm, I saw that the first counter was empty, I went to the polite consultation, was told that I need a staff named Anthony to serve me, so I quickly returned to the line to wait. After another 10 minutes of waiting, no one helped the man and me in front of me (even though there was an empty counter, even though there were staff members there) and a couple cut in line, but the staff actually helped them! I was very angry, I did not understand why it was ignored, I told one of the male employees, I need to find the person in charge, did not think, this so-called manager kept explaining, did not realize the problem, and did not apologize, at this time my daughter was about to cry, I told him, if your employees treat customers kindly, it does not matter if you wait a little longer. It's a shame they can't even say a word, but they're there talking and laughing and fighting? I think the reason why Costco East Valley is doing this is racist, I can't think of any other reason, I have not encountered this kind of thing in other stores. I wonder who gave Costco East Valley the courage to bully a mom and a little girl? ! Can ignore the customer experience, not even a little respect and courtesy to the customer! A weak woman and little girl were racially abused, bullied, ignored, and disrespectfully treated by Costco's East Valley membership counter staff!",

Some shoppers stop and cause traffic jams which are so unnecessary, time consuming, and frustrating. Let's fix this. Have a light on a stick (think back to the Blue Light Specials at Kmart) and place the taster carts in less busy areas or line them up so the folks who want a taste can do that.

I have a hard time even getting a parking space. I have spent more than 15-20 minutes to park my car before!\n\nThe gas station in this location is also overloaded even after the expansion a couple of years ago. 20 minutes wait is normal during peak hours.\n\nCustomer service is also worse than most of Costco in the area. I have had bad experiences even with the manager at the store.\n\nHowever, the store offers good products at reasonable prices. I'll still shop here if I'm at home.

Only members with a card that has their picture id may purchase items from the store. I got red flagged for 6 months because I went shopping without my husband, he had the card with his name on it. They are strict.\n\nThe prices are worth it if you have a family of 4 or more. If it\u2019s just you and your significant other, the bulk prices may be amazing but realistically it\u2019s hard to eat a dozen muffins before they go bad, or enjoy all those huge bottles of juice before they spoil.\n\nDefinitely stock up on alcohol here. Best prices in town for handles of liquor. Their Kirkland brand is basically the exact same as what they are imitating, but with their own name on it. Kirkland vodka is exactly the same as Grey Goose, for a fraction of the price.\n\nThey do not give you bags, but boxes at checkout. They do a great job at recycling boxes that would carry in the veggies.\n\nCome here for a really cheap but satisfying American meal - hotdogs for $1.50 including a drink. Slice of pizza for $1.99. It\u2019s more like 2 medium slices that add up to a lot of pizza. I got a chocolate vanilla frozen yogurt swirl",

      "text": "Navigating the parking lot at the Fullerton Costco can be a challenge. Despite recent efforts to ease congestion by adding another lane, the parking situation remains a hassle. The entrance and exit lanes still struggle to adequately accommodate the high volume of traffic, especially during peak hours.\n\nThe gas station, known for its competitive prices, sees incredibly long lines. Like many others, I've found that arriving at 7:00 AM significantly cuts down the wait time. Otherwise, the wait can be daunting, and I often find myself looking for other cost-effective fuel options in the area.\n\nInside, the store maintains the typical Costco standard with a wide variety of products and generally good customer service. However, the food court is a different story. It often has long lines and can run out of supplies, which can be frustrating. The seating area frequently feels overcrowded and could benefit from better management, particularly during busy times.\n\nDespite these challenges, the savings on bulk goods and gas usually make the trip worthwhile. For a smoother experience, I recommend visiting during off-peak hours to avoid the crowds.",

My grandfather was already ahead of the register, he has his own Costco card and he was paying cash. Everything that my grandfather pays was already in front of Jorge, we have put the divider between our things to avoid confusion. Since Mark and Jorge saw us going together, Jorge asked me if these things are from my grandfather. I said yes, I said he'll pay for his own things first. Since I'm paying with my EBT card, I have to pay for the food after and separately. We already divided our stuff separately, food and non-food things. Jorge should have improved his customer service. We know confusions will arise since we're going together but doing two separate purchases. Jorge mumbled, \"That what I asked from the beginning.\" He mumbled and showed his RUDE attitude like we didn't understand his question. Clearly, we did and I did answer him just do my grandfather's purchase first. I'll do mine next. My  grandfather and I have our own separate Costco cards. Jorge and Mark are the ones that are confused but they blamed us for not understanding them. As a customer, this is the first time I got treated very rude and unprofessional by a Costco employee. I don't need this kind of ATTITUDE towards myself and to my grandfather. My grandfather is old and he cannot speak English. Improve your customer service and attitude, Jorge and Mark!\nCostco, train your employees again with their customer service skills!",

      "text": "An interesting fact about Costco, my Veterinary did not have the antibiotic for my dog and they found it at Costco. The wonderful part is that the cost was extremely low in price at Costco compared to what my vet charges. I did not have a Costco card and I had to be walked in with a worker, but it was worth it and they were extremely nice. This makes me want to get a Costco card. I appreciated this so much, as everyone knows the veterinary charges outrageous prices. Thank you Costco!\n\nSo I just went to Costco to the optical department. The lady there was very nice professional. Help me super fast. I was in and out. And I tell you. I should have got a membership to Costco years ago. Because the eyeglasses were half the price as the last pair I got. So I basically got 241.",

Normally, I would leave a 5 star review because it does meet my expectations.\n\nEdit: If you need your phone unlocked and you are on the \"free\" phone plan, you might have to go through multiple people, but, if you press them, Costco can accelerate the phone payments so that you can unlock your phone.\n\nHowever, I would steer anyone away from the AT&T kiosk. The kiosk is a vendor. It is separate from both Costco and AT&T \u2013 so do not expect either company to help you with any issues that arise. If you choose to use the kiosk:\n1.\tBe very careful that you know what your contract says and do not rely on the assurances of the salespeople.\n2.\tIf you have to call the AT&T Costco line, be aware that you might be transferred to a representative who is not aware of your Costco agreement.\n3.\tIf you are offered a free phone, be aware that you will NOT be able to unlock it (regardless of what the sales staff tell you) without paying off your \u201cfree\u201d phone.\n4.\tIf you decide to return your phone within the 90 day grace period, you will receive no refund or compensation for your previously exchanged phone.\n5.\tEdited: The sales people varied from being helpful to completely unhelpful and excellent customer service to terrible customer service.",

I\u2019m disabled and use motorized carts when I go to large stores such as Costco locations. Thankfully a cart was available and charged. I was next in line and just waiting on the member I was with to present the membership card, and no one behind me in my line. Anyways, the member I was with was taking only like three minutes to get to the line and still no one behind me. Your packer took it upon their self to go to the line next to me to and started taking stuff out of a lady\u2019s cart who was in no obvious way ready to be checked out- after I was told she was going to help the next customer. My stuff was already on the conveyor and my motorized cart was less than a foot away from being behind the check stand so I decided to move up before the stuck up packer could bring the stuff over to be checked out. She could\u2019ve injured me and I would\u2019ve defended myself and sued her personally and your manager on staff and your company. Your cashier didn\u2019t greet and was tapping his finger the whole time the card machine was taking payment. It\u2019s clear Costco could care less about the disabled. Shame on you. Also, make sure all of your locations have ready the motorized carts and enough on hand, otherwise that\u2019s illegal.",

I was innocently sampling focaccia when the vendor complimented me on my Spanish and asked me where I was from. He stated he was from Tijuana and I mentioned that I was going there later this year. I mentioned hearing scary stories in the media about TJ and asked him if it was safe and he said it was, but that I should put my trust in Jesus Christ. I said that I feel that organized religion is worse than whatever killed the dinosaurs and he said, \"I don't believe in dinosaurs.\"  Oh gosh. I can't even. He began to rant and rave about the devastating effects of science and I said, \"Ya estuvo\" and walked away.\n\nAre you kidding, Costo? Really. Is there a policy on this? Are your vendors free to proselytize and promulgate religious propaganda, or is this just a lack of imagination?

I wish they'd be more flexible with how you can pay.\n\nBut, honestly, that's a small thing compared to all the good stuff. Costco is just awesome. Great prices, clean place, and fun snacks. Totally recommend it!",

      "text": "I went here around 3pm on a Sunday and it was raining. The parking lot was packed and traffic was terrible. The way they have it set up to get in line for gasoline is confusing with no clear signs. There is only one line until you get up to the pumps. Cars coming from another direction were trying to cut in and people were getting angry. After getting gas, I just wanted to get out of the parking lot. There is basically one way you have to take to get out of the gas area and it leads you to main road in front of the store. Before I could advance very far, a woman stops in front of me and is waiting for a spot to her left. She waves me on to go around her but it's impossible  due to oncoming traffic. I wait 5-8 minutes and no one is moving and now there is gridlock and a line of stuck cars. People are getting angry and a man lays into his horn but the lady ignores him. He squeezed barely through on her left  leaving inches between cars and cannot proceed past her because a shopping cart is blocking his way. He stops next to her car and tried to get out of his car but can open his door only about 8inches. He begins shouting angrily at the woman and they have a shouting match. Finally the woman removes the cart and he can pass. I was barely able to squeeze past that was woman but scraped my rims on the cement planter. I have a small card but no truck would be able to fit. Last I saw the lady was still waiting for the spot and cars were all honking at her while she ignored them. Such a bad experience, I will never ever go here again.",

My husband is the head chef of a Resturant, and there are days where he is so busy that he can\u2019t step out to get supplies that he\u2019s run out of, so he sends me to buy them for him. Every time I end up with her as my cashier, she always finds an issue with me some way shape or form.  It\u2019s embarrassing to be in the front ready to pay for the merchandise, and subject to her scrutiny because she seems to have all the extra time in the world to ask why I\u2019m purchasing so many bags of brioche buns, which is in turn, none of her business. She\u2019s embarrassed me on more than one occasion and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay. I go to this Costco sometimes several times a week, and I\u2019ve gone with my husband, and I know they\u2019ve seen us both together when purchasing items.

      "text": "I recently had the chance to visit the Costco Wholesale in Huntington Beach, CA, and I must tell you, my experience was unexpectedly pleasant. You know, typically shopping at Costco can be a bit of a hustle, with the packed parking and the post-work crowd, but surprisingly, despite the initial struggle with parking, the rest of my experience was rather positive.\n\nOnce inside the store, which by the way, is located in the bustling Bella Terra, I found it to be well-stocked and organized. The particular item that brought me there \u2013 an SSD Drive \u2013 was available, even though my usual store was out of stock. And this, my friends, is why I love Costco. They always seem to have what you need.\n\nNow, let's talk about the checkout. Despite the very large crowd, I was pleasantly surprised at the efficiency of the process. It was quick, it was easy, and before I knew it, I was out the door. This was a testament to the well-trained and professional staff who handled the constant stream of shoppers like pros.\n\nI must mention though, the long walk back to the car at the front of the mall. It was a bit of a workout but hey, who's complaining about a few extra steps?\n\nIn addition, if you ever need to fill up your tank while shopping, the Costco Gasoline in Huntington Beach is worth a visit. There is always a long line here, but moves quickly and huge savings.\n\nIn conclusion, my visit to the Costco Wholesale in Huntington Beach was a great experience, and I would recommend it to anyone in need of a good deal on a variety of products. Despite the heavy crowds and the slightly far-off parking, the well-stocked store and the swift checkout process more than made up for it. Happy shopping, everyone!",

Family of eight spends quite a bit at Costco monthly and have found that we are getting better service and better products at Sam\u2019s Club and will continue to move away from Costco due to their poor customer service and poor return policy and the way that they are handling returns now. It is stated that they have a customer satisfaction guarantee, however that seems to not be the case anymore when you return some thing they\u2019re having several people look over you and watch over you and watch over your products like you\u2019re trying to steal from them and it is becoming increasingly more uncomfortable and not a satisfaction guaranteed state of mind. Employees are acting like we are taking this amount from their checks directly and it is a very poor customer experience. Bianca had the audacity to say that my profile was negative that I am returning more than I\u2019m spending at certain locations which could not be further from the truth. Again, poor customers, satisfaction, poor customer experience and will again move away from shopping at Costco in the future.",

By focusing on bulk purchases, Costco offers a range of high-quality products at prices that are tough to match elsewhere. This has been a game-changer for me, especially when it comes to stocking up on essentials for my family.But what truly sets Costco apart is not just its prices. The cleanliness of the stores is remarkable. Each time I visit, I find the aisles spacious and well-organized, with products neatly displayed, making shopping both efficient and pleasant. It's clear that Costco prioritizes maintaining a clean and welcoming environment for its customers.Moreover, the staff at Costco deserve a special mention. They are invariably friendly and helpful, ready to assist with a smile. Their efficiency and willingness to go the extra mile add significantly to the overall shopping experience.In conclusion, Costco Wholesale is more than just a store; it's a comprehensive shopping solution that combines great prices, cleanliness, and exceptional customer service. It's a place where shopping feels less like a chore and more like an enjoyable experience. For anyone looking to stretch their dollar further without compromising on quality, Costco is the place to be. 5 stars!",

I like that different sales take place daily to save us money. One thing here that I don't bother buying anywhere else is the Lactose free organic 2% milk. I've tried it from numerous places and this one has the best flavor. Frozen chicken comes in a large bag (2 sizes) and is worth the price!! Money saver plus great quality for the chicken breast. Cara cara oranges are very sweet when in season!!",

I've seen the most improvement in how they handle the entrance to the gas station. People can be crazy trying to get in, but the better setup lends itself to easier servicing, which I gratefully notice as someone who gasses up almost once a week!

From the hoarders at the food stations looking for meal replacements when it's just a sample, to the people not getting out of your way, yes weekends are horrible!  I came in preparing for this and managed to navigate through it just fine.  When it came time to check out, I had a nasty blond cashier woman who loved to inconvenience me.  I had my barcodes up in the cart ready to scan and all of a sudden blond cashier woman said \" we need to have your light items placed on the belt\".  Really lady?  I have like 12 things easily accessible to scan and leave in the cart so it's faster on your end.  So I took all of my things out just to piss them off.  Then she was like \"did you find everything ok?\".  My answer was \"why wouldn't I?\".  If the workers are going to inconvenience their customers even more than they are already battling weekend traffic in the store, I'm going to have attitude.  I'll try to avoid this Costco because the other ones could care less about how things are scanned as long as the customer pays.",

I went anyways, because I waited in line. It\u2019s not my fault they didn\u2019t do their job and let me know that I was in the wrong line. Both girls had so much attitude. I work customer service, and this is not the way you serve people. Im grown adult and don't appreciate being yelled at, stared at and treated this way. There was a much better way of resolving the issue. Completely unacceptable. Costco you got a step up your customer service culture.

You have to be a Costco Member to take advantage of the monthly deals. Discounts are great for people on a strick budget. One good thing about being a member is the cash back on all your purchases that normally can be used for renewing your yearly membership. This store has a gas station. It has a food court to where you can always purchase the cheapest Beef Hotdog that comes with a refillable drink. Other items are also available such as a large pizza,  chicken bake, and soft ice cream served on a huge cup. The tire center is always busy as they have a lot of great offers for their tires. Also available is an air filling station on the side of the tire center. The air they use is nitrogen so it meets the standards of saving gas when used on your tires. Next to the store is a walk to the Lakewood Mall if you want to swing by and shop for Mall Items",

It has an amazing and loyal team, with members that continue to be the friendly faces we see every visit. Everything is always in stock, with the exception of literally twice in about 10 years. And both times they looked it up and were able reserve and ship it for me. They educate and honor warranties on items their consumers purchase from their location. It had a great tire center, electronics department, appliances, phones, jewelry, skincare, pharmacy, and honestly pretty much every department without exaggeration. They are busy and still have time help you find what you need. Their cashier's are speedy and friendly as can be honestly. When the Costco looks mayhem, the cashier's got it down along with the rest of the team. They have an excellent food court and gas station. They even have complimentary air pumps for members. We can't forget the samples of course, they are always good and the team are also like family. We always look forward to our weekly visits \ud83d\ude0a",

Fair enough with today\u2019s technology there\u2019s gotta be a somewhat simple way to prevent that for example\u2026 At Winco when you borrow a scooter, you give them your keys then when you return the scooter, you get your keys back, there\u2019s multiple ways in regard to the theft of course maybe they give yousome random key but there\u2019s got to be something.

I felt like I was asking her for too much or maybe she\u2019s having a bad day and I get it \u2026. But that location really has some very rude females working there and they need to be retrained on how to treat customers or maybe I need to start driving to Santa Clarita where the employees have good customer service.",

The cleanliness of both the store and the restrooms is always up to high standards.\n\nOne of the highlights is their bakery and food court. The quality and taste of their baked goods and meals are fantastic\u2014don't miss the pizza or the hot dogs! Plus, the prices are unbeatable, especially when buying in bulk, which is perfect for families.\n\nAdditionally, Costco's commitment to customer satisfaction is evident in their return policy, which is straightforward and customer-friendly. This location also manages to handle crowds efficiently, minimizing checkout times compared to other stores.\n\nIn summary, shopping at Costco on Sierra College Blvd is a pleasant and cost-effective experience that I highly recommend to anyone looking to get the most out of their budget without compromising on quality.",

I happened to visit this particular Costco store (for the first time) at a terribly busy time.\nParking was a nightmare (which is normally smooth at other stores, depending on the layout of rows and lanes to have the traffic of finding a parking space a smooth endeavor, you definitely need to be  patience).   However, inside the crowded store, the rows and stocked shelves were neat and tidy.\nI found everything that I came looking for.\nAnd I have to remark, the staff were plentiful.  No matter who I dealt with when entering, when leaving, or when asking questions, when looking for certain aisles for particular items, helping me with a price check or assistance on a returned item, ALL staff were kind, patient, knowledgeable, helpful, and downright friendly, even with all the added stress of a huge crowd of customers!   GREAT customer service!",

Fortunately my adult son, who was driving, kept his cool and calmly took the nearest exit which happened to be near the Costco.\nAfter parking, I asked the staff in the tire shop to help us- they advised us to go Mr Car Wash and vacuum the glass- the awesome free vacuum was amazingly efficient.\nWe went back to Costco to wait for AAA to tow us. It began to rain and we had no roof!\nWe again asked for help and the tire shop moved our car inside for shelter.\nI went inside Costco, we are members, we looked for tarps but the only ones for sale are heavy duty stiff plastic ones that would ruin the car paintwork.\nThen I noticed that the mattresses have heavy duty giant plastic bags. But they are not for sale. I spoke to a couple of staff members and they kindly gave me a bag.\nTheir kindness allowed me to cover the roof of my car- by tucking the bag into the doors and the corners under the edge of the hood next to the windshield.\nThe tow truck arrived soon after. We reached our home safely and despite the pouring rain the whole way home, our car interior stayed dry.\nThank you so much for your kindness Costco Staff Manteca.",

It should be clearly stated prior to purchasing a membership. I have my membership and use it once in a while however, I prefer Walmart because of their delivery service, discounted fuel pricing as well as customer service. In comparison to cost savings I\u2019ve actually saved more through Walmart on groceries. However, Costco diapers are the best product! But the rules and cost of a basic membership, along with rising grocery prices will keep my young family utilizing it very minimal to next year no more. Hopefully, family households members are all considered members in the future and specific to the Linda location I hope their training on enforcement of membership rules are also up to par on informing value customers on the rules/restrictions of the memberships in the future.",

The lines may be long at times, but you need to arrive early in the morning around five thirty in the morning when they open to around 10 a.m. That\u2019s the best time if you want to avoid the crowd. It seems with the economy and signs of the times with world conflict gas prices are only going to go up.  Costco Gas also has handicapped services, just honk your horn and make sure your handicapped card is displayed and visible in your rearview mirror.",

However, there are some major concerns about the freshness and quality of their food.\n\nMy husband came home from Costco yesterday and there were two major issues.  The first is that he brought home the famous rotisserie chicken and it was RAW on the inside - huge issue.  The second is that he bought a two pack of Dave's bread and it was long expired - 12/8/23 to be exact.  So the bread is almost one month past expiration.\n\nThe last item that was of concern was my carton of brown eggs.  There was no date on the carton, so I decided to check if the eggs were good.  I placed an egg in a full glass of water and it began to float - which means the eggs are old.  Because of these issues, mostly because of a raw rotisserie chicken, I'm thinking of switching to Sam's.",

Upon checkout, the person checking us out asks if my mom was present and I said she's in the car, she'll be right in. She calls over her supervisor who said I cannot get the groceries because my mom wasn't there when she initially scanned the card. They did not let me purchase the items and had another employee come and collect the items which sucked for them because it was a lot of items. The man was very sassy and had an attitude. I completely understand store policies and procedures but customer service goes a long way. Luckily I went to Sam's club where we also have a membership and they saved the day. Plus the Scan and Go App is a life saver. Obviously we'll be going back because of the membership. I get that people have bad days but it shouldn't be taken out on a customer because they don't know how to express their emotions in a healthy manner. Side note, the cash register person was very sweet, it was just the cranky supervisor.",

One tire had already gone completely flat as the entire side wall had failed (first picture). BF Goodrich has had problems with sidewall failures, and will reimburse customers for the remaining tread toward the purchase of new tires.  Costco also has a similar policy, and I had purchased these tires 3 years ago from Costco.\nI told the employees and managers that all I wanted was the warranty benefits of credit toward the unused tread for the purchase of a new set of tires, since I still had about 10,000 miles left on the tread.\nThe employees and \"managers\" there claimed these off-road tires will fail if I take my truck offroading (which I haven't) and if Armor All \"protectant\" is placed on them.  Funny I didn't see that on any of the warranty information with Costco or BF Goodrich.  The \"manager\" said the \"best\" he could do is give me $30 off a new set off tires, but would not honor either warranty.\nWe have been going to Costco for tires for many years, but this is the final straw.  When they crushed the lug nuts on my truck and made me buy new ones, (which are a custom order from Toyota), I was hesitant to come back here.  But after making us stand in the rain while they sat inside trying to decide how to get out of their warranty, I am done.\nI took my truck to Discount tire on Garnet.  BF Goodrich made good on the warranty, and I saved another $90/tire on the same exact tire Costco was going to sell me.  Discount Tire has a new customer.",

Most prices are favorable however and most of the employees are more often nice and helpful than not so it kinda makes up for the few sour ones.\nI also bought a hotdog and soda on my card on their automatic charging deals but it charged me for two orders which I didn't discover till I got to the front of the line and was being served two orders. It was a little late to complain at that point so I just dealt with it.\nOne manager i talked to for something different.

Without hesitation, the staff member went above and beyond by going behind the line to assist me promptly and efficiently. Her reliability and effectiveness were truly commendable. Her willingness to assist and her dedication to providing excellent customer service left a lasting impression on me. I highly appreciate her efforts and professionalism, making my shopping experience at Costco a positive one.",

I said my three year old has to use the restroom and I had to Littles in car seats that I can't carry and leave on the other side of the registers. She said oh well and stood there waiting for me to go back by the time I got back and unloaded my kids my 3 year old peed everywhere. I was not even attempting to take my cart in the restroom.

Always interests to see what the layout is and it's always so nice and clean. Arrived somewhat early. Wasn't too busy yet. But as the day went on it certainly got busier on a Saturday. Not as busy as some of the other older Costco's in the Sacramento area. Plenty of ample parking spots with also electric car charging spots. They have the same range of products as other Costco's. The restrooms are more accessible, which is nice. This one has a similar feel and layout to the Arden Fair Costco location. People were very nice and friendly here.

Took a few seconds to rearrange the items in the cart, and started scanning the rest of my items. She was done in a flash, and all my items were neatly placed in the cart. She was just doing her job.

I came with the whole cart and alcohol to self check out register, and only half way done was told no alcohol alowed at self check-out. Two of the store attendees were standing at the self check-out registers and \"pretending to work/help customers to process items\". When I heard no alcohol allowed, I asked for the manager, and told him it would be nice to have signs at the registers, so customers see the policy right away. All the supervisor was doing is just keep repeating \"alcohol is not allowed at self-check out\". I told him I am not stupid and I was told that already, but it will be helpful to know that before starting scanning the items, but not half way done.\nThe other attendee, Bertha, was laughing and waving her hand, like I am crazy, when I was trying to explain to them that the policy should be visible. If these are new customer service standards, I don't want to come here again. Just ridiculous to see such behavior in a big corporate chain like #Costco.",

NO GAS STATION\n- Very busy mall\n- Difficult to find parking\n\nSUMMARY:\nMuch to like about this Costco.  But the lack of gas here means you either go towards SF or towards Rohnert - not ideal if you are on the go.\n\nYou can get unique selections due to the area.  The wine is the best I've seen at any Costco.  I found special ice wine from Canada, that's amazing.  The selection of the California wines here is amazing due to the proximity to Sonoma & Napa.",

Issue we have with this Costco is the availability of healthier choices is minimal - from Mary's crackers no longer being available, to blueberries constantly being out of stock, to the lack of availability of good eggs.

      "text": "Bad customer services and bad Costco practices.  Yesterday we bought two citrus trees at $19.00 each, indicating fast sale.  At cashier, it was $26.99 each.  We caught the mistake, and it was corrected after some maneuvering.  Imagine if customer is not vigilant. Then we noticed sales tax was added on the fruit trees, which shouldn't based on our experience.  I then talked to two managers at least that are what they claimed, named Ramone and Sherrie, who said that is Costco policy of adding sales tax on fruit trees based on California law.  I showed them California Board of Equalization Regulations 1588 regarding seeds, plants and fertilizers, which clearly states no sales tax on fruit trees. Then they said Costco policy supercedes whatever.  They said if you don't like this Costco policy, then don't buy it.  These two self-claimed managers continued to escalate their hostilities.  If these are the people working for Costco, and Costco continues thinking that they are too popular and too big to fail, it will be like Sears and the likes.  I also simulated buying an apple tree from Amazon, and it showed no sales tax applied.  Imagine how many loyal customers have been ripped off by Costco.  I also remember many years back when Costco was selling discounted items but sales tax based on the original price.\n\nAfter writing the above, I reviewed the receipt carefully and I see the problem as follows: when scanned at $26.99, the item is called Citrus Tree and there is no \"A\" after $26.99, indicating no sales tax.  When the same item was re-scanned at $19.00, another so-called manager called the item 27 GARDEN, then an \"A\" appears, indicating sales tax.  The problems of bad customer services are still there as follows:\n1.  These two clown idiotic so-called managers, RAMONE and SHERRIE, as well as other employees kept insisting it is Costco policy to add sales tax to fruit trees.  They even called me tax cheater.\n2.  Bad attitudes, such as \"if you don't like this Costco policy, don't buy it\", \"you can always hire your attorney to challenge Costco\", and on and on.\n3.  I got ripped off, and probably other customers as well.\n4.  This is not one Costco employee making a mistake.  This is three so-called managers together with employees ganging up to stonewall a long-time customer's legitimate concerns.  Instead of helping, they aggravate.",

I go to Costco once a week and business center about once a month. My favorite things to stock up on are paper plates, cutlery, cleaning supplies, drinks, protein shakes, frozen fruits, baking items (they have AMAZING cocoa powder), gum, and bagged snacks. They have tons of snacks there that you can\u2019t get anywhere else. I particularly love their variety of flavored nut packs. My kids love getting things like popcorn or baked chips and I love the prices on these things. Snacks can quickly kill the budget, so I really appreciate the low per unit cost on these items.

I scheduled an appointment on May 6th using their new appointment system that specifically asked for the order number. I went to the tire center as scheduled to find out that: 1. Tires did not arrive. 2. Agent was surprised that I placed an order online and did not call to confirm the order delivered. 3. Said order might get delivered tomorrow, and I should wait for a call from them, and then discuss with them a reschedule of the appointment (just imagine when the new appointment will be). So overall, not sure what the benefit of the appointment system is if it simply books an appointment AND asks for the order number if the order isn't delivered. That appointment system AND online orders need to talk to one another. I trust no one from Costco will have time to read this review or put an action plan to fix these issue for future.",

No wonders there\u2019s guys pushing more than 10 carts, since they feel the pressure from management, then some managers have favoritism,I once got promoted to be a merchandiser in the morning and since I switch with another person who wanted to push carts I when Inside to work in the warehouse . When that person  shift was over we switch back and management  blame me since there was a bunch of carts and I lost my promotion. Then for what ever reason they would write you up .  I understand if your late 3 times you deserve a write up but these guys would write you  you up for anything even if they expected you to clean one section of the store by stocking and condensing yourself and if you didn\u2019t finish well write up \u2026. Or If a supervisor didn\u2019t like you write up they would find what ever reason to write you up and that would stay in your employee profile . Most of the managers like Elaine , or Felipe   Or the other second  warehouse manager some short guy would always come out with his vape pen to take a smoke on the job and walk around the lot he was just a red flags . The only good manager who would always understand his employees was Ricky ,  John  the manager   and Kenny  who used to work their , or David who use to be a supervisor  these guys were the best of this Costco warehouse .",

I was thrilled to find the alkaline water packs, grabbing three of them. With 18 bottles priced at just $11, not only was the value unbeatable, but the water tasted pure and refreshing. To top it off, their selection of organic orange juice was impressive. Fresh, flavorful, and a wide range to choose from. This Costco location truly stands out with its quality products and competitive prices. Will be returning soon for more great finds! Highly recommended.",

It took longer for the supervisor to return to the pickup desk and get our tickets than it took standing in line(probably four minutes). She wasn\u2019t rude, but wasn\u2019t friendly. She also only handed us one set of tickets when we ordered two. We had to correct her. Simple mistake. However, if management should read this review, your cage where you keep your pickup items was open. The door wasn\u2019t closed completely. I could\u2019ve walked right in. This wasn\u2019t an accident as when she exited to give us our tickets, she purposely left it ajar.\n\nOverall, not a bad experience. Restrooms were remarkably clean considering the sheer amount of humanity going in and out. Kudos!\n\nGotta love Costco!",

I would go just here to stock up on the explosive prices on meat that my local Costco doesn\u2019t carry. Everybody just minds there business and everybody seems friendly. It\u2019s very clean well kept and we where there for a couple hours walking to aisles all around looking for needed groceries plus new things to try. My baby loves coscto since we shop there many times a week I know he loved how big it was and loves to look at the fans spinning on top of the ceilings. I love it I\u2019d definitely come back once we eat up all these meats we horded for our deep freezer. We are a family of 3 but my fianc\u00e9 is a big man and eat a lot of food. So we will definitely make our way back into town!",

It looks clean and new inside, with big stuffs inside  so you won\u2019t bump into someone else while shopping. Most products are fully stocked and some jumbo sets for business or large family are available.\n\nThe layout  is a bit different from regular Costco, the frozen and refriged area are combined, not as many yogurt brands as the regular,\nLots of items (seasoning and spices) are huge packages.\nMountains and mountains  of TP( toilet paper) and PT ( paper towels)\nLots of stocks of face masks.\nNo bakery, no wine section. Understandably this is business center.\nNice to see the seasoned staff training the young newbies on site.\nIt's clean and very organized everywhere even though there're lots of lots of customers.\nOne thing for sure everywhere in Costco,  you never need to worry about the quality,  and unbeatable price.\nCrowded parking lot since big part of it is still under construction.\n\nTheir service is great than ever in any Costco, they really eager to help to anyone. Staff are really great.",

On our 2nd trip, we brought along our small dog without knowing that dogs are not allowed inside, until we were told by an older lady at the entrance. However, even after acknowledging her and the crowd in front of us finally cleared, she made sure to point the sign to us that dogs are not allowed. After dropping our dog off in the car and made our entry, the same lady was still talking about us and our dog with the other lady at the exit. At checkout, and just like our first time, we tried to put some of our things from the cart onto the belt but stopped after a register helper vigorously started to. To our surprise, we got a similar comment from both helpers on both trips. The first time, we were told \"Are you going to help\", and the second time was, \"Thanks for the help\" both accompanied by frustrated looks and tone directly at my wife and I. If it weren't for the nice guys at the meat section, this customer experience rating would've been a 1-star.",

A hallmark of Costco.  There's a couple spots at the front of the store that is used as a loading zone.

While they appeared fresh in the box, upon tasting them, I found them to be very old and lacking in flavor. This is not the first time I've encountered such issues with the produce at Costco Sand City. Last week, I also purchased green beans that were not only old but also moldy. I feel embarrassed to take them back and return them.\nAs a loyal Costco member, I have always trusted the quality of your products. However, these recent experiences have left me concerned about the standards of your produce selection at the Sand City location. I believe that as a reputable retailer, it is essential to maintain high-quality standards to uphold customer satisfaction.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and resolution.",

The employee repeated that they do not have the item available on the floor. After hearing my friend's attempt to get help I then roamed the store looking for an employee who would help me. After finding what seemed to be a supervisor, I received the help I needed after the first associate came back to check the isle again, even though the other supervisor and I found it. He walked the isle and still did not see it until I pointed it out again. Once he came back with the lift to get the pallet the employee then continued to make remarks to his colleague that defended his poor attempt at stocking the shelves. Still leaving 5 stars to not spread anymore negativity but this employee needs to practice their service skills. They did apologize once he handed me the product I asked for but it shouldn't have taken us 20 minutes to get the item or service my friend politely asked for.",

That's your problem, put more cameras, security personnel, barcode alarms. It's your problem, not mine. Don't tell me every day \"let's see if you stole anything today\".",

      "text": "My experience with Costco is that the food court is terrible!! \ud83d\udcaf They hire people use them up and fire them!!\ud83d\udcaf They waste tons of food, which doesn't make sense because they say that they donate their food but I have personally worked in snack area and watch them throw on a daily at least 20 pizzas because they had bubbles in them or ugly!! They threw away any food that isn't made right meaning somebody ordered it they made it the wrong way but it's perfectly fine... It's sad that there are tons of people in this world have nothing to eat and they are literally throwing away tons and tons of food on a daily!!! Facts are Costco is a very very wasteful !! Facts are I got hurt on the job working there and was fired as soon as I came back and they didn't have to give me a reason because it was before my 90 days!! So my advice to anybody that is going  working there if you get hurt don't report it or you get fired!!\ud83d\udcafFacts!! My supervisor was Jimmy he bullied me and along with my other supervisors in the food court, l did want l was told to do , when I got hurt they told me to report it and then they stopped talking to me they started treating me like I wasn't there they started giving me dirty looks if l asked a questions they flat out ignored me and walked away giving me dirty looks like little kids !! I went to work every day like I was supposed to l did my job 200% and yet I was fired for doing what they told me to do which was making incident report.. l have never been let go from any job!! Because I'm a really good worker \ud83d\ude01 I take pride in everything that I do big or little and I would never stoop to the level they did but l will not be quite about this!!, if I would have been fired for doing anything wrong \ud83e\udee3 I could accept that but I wasn't I was let go because I got hurt \ud83e\udd15 and it ruined their safety goals!! Jimmy, Juliet, and Brandon l will pray for you \ud83d\ude4f!! You are welcome for the fantastic job l did!! I know l am a great employee!! Bullying new employees is sad , sham on you for playing with people's jobs that have families because you're feeling some kind of way not because I did anything wrong but because I did exactly what I was told to do because I didn't want to get fired!!! Lol  that's funny!! To anybody going shopping at the Natomas Costco  the food court is disgusting, don't eat there!! You will wait hours for a pizza crazy they will tell you to call and order ahead but they don't answer their phone they don't care about you they will cuss you out and not even get in trouble of it!!!  I witnessed it myself!! Spare yourself and go to a different store this one isn't worth your time!! I use to love Costco, not anymore!! God bless!!\ud83d\udcaf",

However, yesterday, I experienced something utterly ridiculous at this Costco. They have made a new rule where associates block off aisles for customers to get them out of the store as soon as it hits 8:30 pm(closing time).\n\nCustomers who enter the store before closing time cannot complete their shopping. The associates will stand in front of the aisles and tell you that you can not get anything from this aisle and that they are closing now.\n\nIf the employees are rushing to leave early, management should plan a different strategy rather than having the associates play the role of bouncers at a club.",

Any holes in bag that occur between the display and my car means I could easily have chicken juice on my car upholstery.\n3. It could easily also get on the belt st the register.\n4.

Wasn't crowded at all on a weekend, so was easy to shop here as SJ Costcos are ALWAYS crowded.\n\nThe gigantic 2-count cooked frozen lobsters (in-season) were so delicious ($11.99/lb) and super fresh, 1 of the lobsters even had eggs, which were so yummy!  We prefer lobster over Dungeoness crabs.\n\nRotisserie Chicken and BBQ Ribs looked like they were exceptionally popular here as they were nearly all sold out.\n\nLoved the greenhouse going for $1,349.99 even though it's made with plastic instead of glass windows.\n\nJewelry section was very limited and didn't display the usually higher priced items (ie: the 10ct diamond tennis necklace) like all of the other Bay Areas have.  But they had a nice selection of 14k yellow gold jewelry for great prices here.",

      "text": "Dear Costco management,\n\nI love Costco, who doesn't, but this obsessive moving items around for the shopper to \"meander around and stumble upon new treasures\" is annoying, irritating and well underhanded. It's obvious why it is done.\n\nIn Costco mission statement it states: taking care of members and employees. How does moving stuff around every day fit in the statement. The employees themselves don't know where items are most likely because swing shift probably doesn't let day shift know. Then again maybe that's intentional?\n\nSuggestions: have the one shift alert the other of the major item movement during morning meetings, so they a least have an inkling of were products are so when a member asks they sort of know the general location. Two move things around less often and three if you insist on moving things around put like things in like places. Example nuts with nuts not in some random place. Yes I experienced that. Walnuts were in a completely different location then the others.\n\nIf you really want to \"take care of membership and employees\" stop moving things around every single day. Yes, I have walked out of the store twice because I was so frustrated and went elsewhere. Why because its annoying.\n\nMembers and employees don't need items moved around for \"our\" benefit to find a new deal. It only benefits Costco, which I get you have the right to do what ever you like, but really every single day and twisting that around so its beneficial for the member...It's about filling up the cart and not convenience (which  I guess you might agree with that).\n\nPS this may seem petty to some and maybe it is in the overall scheme things but it's very annoying and not about convenience. People love Costco, if they want something they will seek it out. There is no need to make that more complicated in the name of finding treasures.\n\nThanks for letting me vent.\n\nPaul Borg (Willits)",

To do this he has to ask one of his daughters to take the day off and travel the two hours to get there.\nThey did such a shopping trip yesterday and once the got home, they realized one of the items they purchased was really $50 more than they believed. I called on my father\u2018s behalf to explain what a hardship it is to return such an item and management services took good care of the issue. I want to thank Costco for always putting their customers first above the dollar. Kudos to Taylor in management services for taking her time and taking care of my father.

However, a recent encounter with a particularly rude manager left me questioning the brand's commitment to customer satisfaction.\n\nDespite my initial excitement over finding a dresser I liked, marked down from $899 to $699, my enthusiasm quickly waned due to the poor treatment I received at checkout. While the helpfulness of employees like, I think his name was Felipe, who went above and beyond to assist me, was commendable, it was overshadowed by the unprofessional conduct of certain staff members.\n\nDuring checkout, I was appalled to overhear the cashier and bagger openly criticizing the value of the dress I was purchasing. Their disparaging remarks uttered in full earshot, reflected poorly on the store's commitment to customer satisfaction and respect.\n\nThe real disappointment, however, came when I encountered the manager. Not only did she exhibit a dismissive and condescending attitude towards both myself and Employee Brian (Loader), who was trying his best to accommodate my needs, but she also seemed entirely disinterested in resolving the situation amicably. Her disregard for my concerns and blatant lack of professionalism left a lasting impression.\n\nDespite the challenges I faced, the helpfulness and kindness of Brian, Felipe, the lady who checks receipts, and the four gentlemen who actually loaded the item into my truck, ultimately salvaged the situation. Their willingness to assist me in finding a solution and accommodating my needs stood in stark contrast to the behavior exhibited by the manager and the cashiers.\n\nWhile I understand that every business may encounter its fair share of challenges, I hope this feedback serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining a standard of excellence in customer service. If Costco truly values its customers, it must address rudeness and unprofessionalism among its staff, particularly those in managerial positions.\n\nAs a side note, I am extremely happy with the dresser and its worth every penny and hassle I went through to get it home.",

Not to mention, this place is so flooded at all open hours so that my family always waits until 30 minutes before closing to avoid the extremely large crowds. On top of that, the at&t employee lied about their promotions to get my service switched over and when I mailed in my perfectly good phone to them (she said they would accept for a trade in), they denied it, kept my phone and now I have to pay in full for a phone I didn't even need.

I waited a few min and did not come so I went back outside mean time the manager comes to a register and takes a customer she then goes back to drop what ever the previous customer returned and stays there just taking to an other employee like if no customers are waiting her name is Silvia I just could not people Costco allows these people to just chit chat when the line is almost to the parking lot. She then took me and I told her how could she just be taking seen the line she said they had something important to talk, I could tell she just did not care for the customers taking her little time to go back and forth. I love Costco this is my second time visiting this store and I know it\u2019s a busi store but when employees ignore the customers time it\u2019s very upsetting..",

Then the shorter of the two said I\u2019m not a dog?? Obviously! I explained my father would whistle at us as children and I whistled to my children and now grand children and they understand it\u2019s easier to get their attention. But this guy wouldn\u2019t stop yelling I\u2019m not a dog, I\u2019m not a dog\u2026 obviously! So I called to speak with a manager to explain I was not trying to offend him but his behavior was not appropriate. Then this manager a young girl began where he left off regarding he\u2019s not a dog?? Seriously what is with theses individuals that get so offended over a whistle? When they whistle at girls and girls don\u2019t get affected negatively so I was in a debate with this girl over the foolish reactions of both reminding her I am the customer asking for help a 65 year old woman trying to get help??? Seriously this has never happened in any other Costco not LA not La Jolla, not Carlsbad, but theses person\u2019s are unbelievable over a whistle that was not a dog whistle was a single long whistle to get the attention of a employee over 200 feet away???",

Secondly, there are not very many people, in principle. If you are in a period when there are a lot of customers, then three people work at the checkout. The cashier himself and two assistants, who work very quickly, put the products in boxes in four hands. It is very convenient and very fast. Thirdly, here you will always find some products or products for the promotion. According to my observations, this happens once every one or two weeks. Personally, I buy. There are a lot of things for work and various tools and utensils for the house. I highly recommend it, you won't be disenchanted, that's for sure.",

From the moment I stepped up to the counter, the pharmacist made it clear that she had little regard for professionalism. First and foremost, she talked down to me in a manner that was not only disrespectful but also very embarrassing! She made me feel as if my concerns over MY MEDICATION didn't matter and that I was wasting her time.\n\nAs if her treatment of me wasn't bad enough, her behavior toward her colleagues was equally appalling. I witnessed her yelling at another employee in full view of me and other customers in the middle of our conversation! Her lack of professionalism was not only embarrassing but also deeply concerning, as it raised serious questions about the work culture and ethics of the pharmacy as a whole.\n\nThis isn't the first time I've had issues with the pharmacists at this Costco, but despite my attempts to address the issues with the store manager, I think his name is Robert, nothing has been done. I feel so bad for the employees who have to work here...\n\nI don't feel safe having my prescriptions filled here anymore. I've already begun transferring them out and I highly recommend that others do the same! These people in the white coats are completely incompetent! At least the employees in blue try to help... People these days are just horrendous.",

Reason I am give a 4 star is because instacart shoppers are no longer allowed in self check out so even if you have just a few items they make you wait in the regular lines which can take quite some time.\nTIPS\nAvoid coming here on sunday it could take a while to find parking and very long lines.

I\u2019m a dog owner and love dogs but don\u2019t want them around my food. They are prepping and serving food in there.  People petting and getting licked by their dog and reaching across the food. Seems gross. I\u2019m getting old\u2026",

I do not understand why in the world the opening hours are so late (10 AM as of this writing). I imagine the crowd would be much less if they opened the store earlier in the day, say at 8 AM. Many people who prefer to relax by coming in earlier... So why is Costco so late to open their doors to their members?",

We should be able to have a single family card that anybody in the household can use. Same with the Costco credit card.  Nope. We each have to have our own Costco card and each need our own separate credit card.  It wasn\u2019t that long ago when you could have a single household credit card as long as both husband and wife were on the account.  I understand cracking down on sharing with friends and extended family, but come on. This is too much.  There was also zero advertising about these changes. I had a cart full of groceries last week and was refused service because my wife happens to be the one who signed up for the account.  I didn\u2019t receive an email, nor a phone call, and there has been nothing about this in the circular that\u2019s sent to us every couple weeks.  Get it together Costco!",

Having another person acknowledge me on a bad day made a world of difference and i still think about that interaction\nThere's also a guy in the gasoline station who makes conversation with everyone and is always in a good mood. Sometimes these little interactions make me feel like a person and I appreciate the employees who work here. So, thanks Costco.

My tires were in stock and they said they could get me in and out. So I walked across to Trader Joe's.....came back! Seeing a super dark sky heading in from the west! The greeter was fine with my Trader Joe stuff so I grabbed the few items I needed and headed over to get my car. They said they had to wait and I was to move to the middle of the store as the front doors were going down. I was getting Tornado warning from my daughter and on my cell. The General Manager and ENTIRE staff were BEYOND INCREDIBLE!!! They moved stuff quickly and efficiently and then we were told adamantly by Melanie to get back to the coolers NOW!!  Very grateful for her and the ENTIRE STAFF!!",

Costco knows what you need better than you do, which is great, until you go there for 1 item and leave with a cart full and an empty wallet.

The only problem is that the one in Shelby has been getting more and more busy with increasingly annoying people, it seems. I now dread going because I know I will have to park and shop with all those people. It has ruined my experience, but the items are worth traversing the traffic jam of a place.",

You then have to pass back through the exit flow to get to the entrance on the far right.\nIf they had switched entrance and exit, it would have been much better.\nBut this was also the layout that felt the Fuel Center entrance and exit should be the parking lanes. My first time here, I was stuck in my parking spot for a very long time because of this.\nThis layout is terrible.

      "text": "Impressive Inventory and Eco-Friendly Practices at Costco Ann Arbor, Michigan\"\n\n\"I recently visited the Costco location in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and I must say, it left quite an impression. Unlike our Costco back in Southlake, TX, this warehouse was bustling with shoppers, and it's easy to see why. The abundance of inventory was remarkable, and it seemed like they had everything, including a variety of products on clearance.\n\nOne aspect that stood out to me was the thoughtful approach to sustainability. The presence of trash cans specifically designated for landfill and recycling was a positive surprise. It's a small but impactful step towards reducing environmental impact, and it's great to see a big retailer taking such measures.\n\nThe spacious layout of the warehouse, similar to other Costco locations, made shopping a breeze, and the large parking lot provided convenience. My husband and I also enjoyed exploring products that we don't usually find in our local Costco. It's clear that this location caters to a diverse range of preferences.\n\nAdditionally, the expansive food court was a pleasant surprise. It offered a variety of options for a quick bite after a shopping spree. The overall experience at Costco Ann Arbor, Michigan, was delightful, and the combination of a vast inventory, eco-friendly practices, and convenient facilities makes it a standout location in our book. Highly recommended for both the shopping enthusiasts and those looking for a more sustainable retail experience.\"",

      "text": "I freaking LOVE Costco's Business Centers! As a former employee of 18 years, I will never not brag about Costco. They just do it right. They treat their employees right and offer such a great quality and value to their members.\n\nMy favorite thing about the Business Center is the variety of drinks, snacks, office supplies and bulk quantities of supplies geared towards small businesses. I've purchased items for my online sales. I've purchased snacks to donate to our local police department or for personal use. I appreciate that they have some core Costco items as well (shampoo, conditioner, personal items, etc). Tofu is a great price. The 20lb boxes of pasta is a great price. Everything is great!\n\nThe staff is super helpful, too! It was a pleasure speaking with Clay for a while about my previous Costco experience.\n\nAnyone with a Costco membership is welcome. Keep in mind that there are no ancillary departments (optical, hearing aid, meat, deli, pharmacy, food court, etc). Please don't complain about it, either. It's called a Business Center!",

During the winter, I had made a turn into the first left parking lot and ended up scraping the entire passenger side of my SUV.  I didn\u2019t see the rock was sticking out way passed the curb as my SUV sits very high.  After getting out to see the damage, I looked at the rock and I\u2019m assuming whomever plows their parking lot ran into the huge rock and pushed it over the curb.  You could tell by the tire marks on the landscaping and the drag marks the rock made as it was being pushed.  I filed a claim with management whom seemed annoyed and tried to talk me out of filing a claim.  To make it even worse the claim was denied because COSTCO said whatever happens in their parking lot is not their responsibility and they refused to give me the name of the company who plows their parking lot for me to address it with them.",

      "text": "Awful experience. No carts at either the row I parked in or inside. Asked for card to enter and made to stop until I had it out. Asked for my card while shopping and told I had to show it. I had to AGAIN show my card in order to even go to the self checkout register. My arms were completely full of groceries including clothing items, since there were no carts available. I was told to put my items down (on the ground  ???) to get my card out of my wallet, in my purse. I told them it was inside my purse and was told that I was not allowed to go to a register until I provided it. When I got it out of my wallet it was then promptly ripped out of my hand by the staff member to verify my photo ID on the back, causing me to drop my wallet. No apology. Two very large garage type items in the store had no prices on them, and when I asked staff member they said I would have to carry the item all the way to the front to have the scan it through to tell me the price. Again, no carts so I would have to carry this large item to the front. Bkueberres were moldy. The funny thing about my entire trip is that the girl checking receipts when I left swiped my receipt and didn't bother to look at any of the stuff I had in my arms or count them. I had multiple black clothing items covering the groceries in my arms underneath and there's no way she could have had any idea what I was carrying. At least this one was polite and told me to have a nice day. Definitely do not recommend this location.",

After he was finished, I went into the parking lot and asked another consumer if she had recieved the same treatment because she too used the self checkout.  She said no.  And we agreed that I would talk to a manager. I then spoke to Scott and he defended the young man.  He then told me he would check the camera to see if he had done the same thing to other customers who had used the self checkout,  speak to Johnathan and call me with the outcome. It has now been a year and I still have yet to get that call back.\n\nNo one wants to be the victim of discrimination or unfair treatment\nThis is terrible.

(check out stands), I turned to politely inform him. I wasn't going to take the cart into the restroom, but I needed to get down the hall to the restroom. And he said I couldn't pass and physically detained me., When he called over, the young man who was helping others check out and told him to detain me and to move all my stuff into a cart . Good boy said that I could walk all the way down the hall and leave my stuff. I explained that I was in pain, which is why I was using the cart in the first place. So he unloaded my whole car into a car. And I proceeded forward completely Embarrassed. So when I came out there was another lady. Walking down the hall pushing a FULL CART  And he was watching her . When I confronted him, he said, TOO BAD, it's the rules. This is absolutely disability discrimination, and I feel sorry for any seniors or permanently handicapped people that might have to endure this man. A kind man named Michael helped  me reload my cart. The discriminating man have a ponytail, and you can see Him waving and smirking in the picture as the other man helped me. Never going back to this costco, which I was really excited to get my executive membership from my Chef, who spends a lot of money and also will not be going back to this discriminatory location.",

He spent so much time chatting in his language with a folk to do 1 return of a shirt. The line was getting longer as he kept chatting which was not professional at all. Then it came my turn, I wanted to return 4 shirts because the price went different. No asking or anything, he just used a higher price to do the return. For a self-claim manager for 7 years, he didn't know why people want to do a return and insisted me to do a return in a higher price. Why would someone do a return in a higher price, let's ask yourself that question, Basel!\nMore disrespectfully as he went, he proceeded to put words in my mouth by saying loudly I didn't respect him and what not. I simply told him, \"If you can't do it, just cancel the return\". Basel went on with his stupid accusation and didn't want to listen to my explanation, he gave no care how a long line was waiting for his 7-year profession and how loud he was. I was infuriated as he kept putting words in my mouth and did not let me speak, I eventually said louder that if he couldn't do it, stopped it and cancelled it.\n\nBasel displayed a lack of patience and courtesy. Instead of addressing my concerns with empathy and understanding, he exhibited dismissive and condescending behavior. As a member who values the customer service standards set by Costco, this experience was highly disheartening.\n\nALL OTHER employees, they are extremely helpful and thoughtful whenever I did any return. I don't care if they are non-manager level, their experience and service always met the expectation and wonderful. I understand that everyone has bad days, but I believe it is crucial for managers, especially in customer-facing roles, to maintain a level of professionalism and courtesy at all times. Especially when you call yourself \"I'm a 7-year manager\", think 7 times before you speak!",

      "text": "Impressive Experience at Costco Business Center - Zuni St., Denver, Colorado\"\n\nI recently visited the Costco Business Center on Zuni St. in Denver, Colorado, and I must say, it surpassed my expectations. Having previously been to the Dallas location, the size difference was immediately noticeable. The walk-in refrigerated room is a colossal space, possibly around 20,000 sq ft, providing an extensive range of products.\n\nOne aspect that stood out was the impeccable organization and cleanliness throughout the facility. Unlike the chaos often found in other wholesale stores, this Costco Business Center maintains a neat and tidy environment. The commercial appliances section was a delight, offering a diverse range of products catering to various businesses.\n\nSimilar to regular Costco locations, the parking lot is spacious, making the shopping experience convenient. It's worth noting that, like other business centers, there are no samples or gas stations. This, however, doesn't take away from the overall positive experience.\n\nIn summary, if you're looking for a Costco Business Center that goes above and beyond, the Zuni St. location in Denver is a must-visit. The vast refrigerated room, organized layout, and extensive commercial appliance selection make it a standout choice for business and bulk shopping.",

I come to this Business Costco when I need large quantities of items for my business- large bags of flour, sugar, powdered sugar, cornstarch in big tubs, boxes, bags, deli wax paper, storage or mixing containers, and more. I enjoy the selection of snacks- think of it as the place where cool kids shop to fill their vending machines. It\u2019s not a place for a jaunty grocery shopping experience though- no samples, fresh bakery, or small cheese blocks. Need a frozen goat? Here you go. 10 pounds of chopped onions? Yep. An unsliced block of prosciutto? Right here! They do have lots of premade salad bowl varieties in 4 packs and boxes of ramen cups in multiple flavors, which we like. In pandemic times, I appreciated the industrial size boxes of pasta and other staples. So you know, this Costco is geared to restaurant/business owners\u2019 needs, not a family outing grocery run.",

When asked, a staff told me that books don\u2019t sell well, instead, they expanded their alcohol selections. Every single time when I was at Costco, I see people browsing and buying books.\n\nLet\u2019s move on to food quality. A few times that I have purchased raw food from Costco, I noticed they have a funky smell. Expired? Nope. Not sure what\u2019s going on here but I will let it slide. However, TWICE now I have noticed boxes of Madeline are still being sold when they are long past the use by date. The first time (2022), I brought it up to the front desk manager. I was told \u201cwe are not perfect.\u201d That is understandable. What\u2019s shocking is today I went to the store and there they are, another expired batch that is still being sold in store and some of them are already moldy! It\u2019s time to upgrade your inventory system!\n\nLastly, as mentioned by many other shoppers, every single time the store is packed, not to mention the parking is a nightmare! You\u2019d think checkout takes forever, then at least you are done. Nope! The receipt-checking people really do take their time too! So apart from needing a better inventory system, getting what Sam\u2019s club has will do you good - a receipt and item scanning machine!",

What is the excuse & how does a store exist being operated dysfunctionally? Obviously there is something wrong with how this store runs with the current customers. I just don't understand why all these customers allow to shop & operate this way. Was thinking to get something from the food court to see 80+ people waiting for food. Then the two lines to get out, was pushed all the way back for yet another 8~ to exit. Should be a fire risk without enough staff to handle the amount of customers. Can't wait to be done with my membership that I can only handle going a few times a year. Ugh! Tried the one in Parker, almost as bad  I've given up on Costco.\nUpdate a year later 11/17/23, Friday @ 10:30 AM (Last Picture).  Sad to say, things haven't gotten better & probably worse.\nLast two times lines go back to end of store (15 mins). People cursing in line. Then broken into two long lines, where people with full carts doing self checkout, because the lines are too bad. Then by the time to checkout stands, a number of them are closed? WT? Poor: Setup, Management, Costco leadership to have this known issue to happen even a year later. No Thanks! \ud83d\ude2b\nPoorly staffed without enough check stands open/blocked. On a Sunday the line kid you not goes all the way to the back of the store. People complaining & walking away from their full carts. Picture proof",

I'd say it's worth the membership! Years ago, I paid DOUBLE, and that was WITH insurance. (Eye Clinic at Evans Army Hospital definitely didn't steer me wrong about getting glasses at Costco!)\n\nMy suggestion is to take pictures in front of mirror of glasses you're trying on, then picture of frame with item number, and repeat it for all the frames you like. It makes it easier to narrow down. When you've made your choices, you can literally walk to the counter and they will get frames from your picture and get you set up with your prescription.

I bought a Vitamix blender for $100 less than I could find anywhere else for the exact same model.  The selection and quality of meats is great for those that love to grill or smoke meats.  Over the years we\u2019ve bought multiple kitchen and home items and they are all good quality items.  The staff is really helpful when you\u2019re trying to find a specific item.  If you have pets, you won\u2019t find a better price on pet food, toys, or treats.",

      "text": "Costco is one of our favorite places to shop because of its exceptional services! However, today was different. So my husband and I had brought in our F150 truck for some new tires. So after we checked in for our 1 o'clock appointment, we were told it would probably take a hour and half for the whole process to complete. We thought it makes sense to do our little shopping while waiting. Hour and half rolled around for us to go check the status for the vehicle just to find out that someone had ordered the WRONG TIRES! For whole hour and half of us waiting, no has the decency to call and let us know, because we could have used the time to go to other locations such as Ford Motor, Discount Tires, and many more..Okay, I get it that we make mistakes, we\u2019re human! But what I didn't get is that why didnt one call and at least tell us?  And when we were there talking to this one guy, or the other employees, none of  them acknowledged the situation. Or at least apologize for having the customers waited for no reason. We apologize when we make mistakes it's in us, humans. Or in business world sometimes it's called \u201ccustomer service.\u201d\n\nI hope this situation doesn't have in the future. Take this review as a reminder.",

For the most part was having a great experience from the greeter to the person that eloped me out with the membership.\n\nI strolled around and initially seemed the main  issue were the customers.  Which I'm not putting on the store. I immediately seemed apparent customers are not too courteous navigating the aisles. Individuals that seem to be in a rush while getting flustered moving their carts in the left side of wrong direction. Even in stores believe should keep a sense of direction to avoid bumping to others around corners. That alone was just the first impression besides the \"high MakaMaka\"  demeanor most customers and some staff exhibited. I would like to believe they're not locals but I'm afraid they're for the most part the very individuals complain about other chains customers. To top it off carts are just left wherever as nobody sees to bother putting them back. People just standing blocking narrow aisles with no concern for others.\n\nAnyways on to the actual staff and store gripes.\n\n1. The cashier didnt seem too friendly.\n2. The cashier in food court more obviously rude with an attitude she was annoyed to take order and bit rude asking which method of payment as if I had an idea there were kiosks which I didn't notice until after. Mandi could use some training in customer service.\n3. I don't recall Costco checking all receipts which created a long line and I did ask the door person which he stated all Costco do so. While it's understandable at the same time it is bit excessive in my opinion.\n\nI sure hope to have a better experience in future visits.",

Because every time, there\u2019s an employee yelling at me and speaking to me like some kind of criminal mastermind. Last time it was for splitting our transaction (with the same bank card might I add) one for food for a party and one for food for our home - as we try to keep track of our budget. This time? For having two carts. We\u2019re a family of 6, we buy a lot of stuff. Isn\u2019t that the point of Costco? Why do I feel like using the membership I paid for always comes with a headache and anxiety?",

Shockley the line at Parker started at the front corner of the store and wrapped around to the back & full isle, then from the back to end. People blocking lanes & cursing during the holidays. Took 30+ minutes & in the selfservice has one person supporting. Mine was locked up with technical issues & seeing a bunch of the managers hanging out with no sense of urgency or help.\nPoorly managed & feel for the employees & customers, while the corporation makes money.\nI will NOT renew my membership. SAD!",

I will never buy Whirlpool, Maytag, or KitchenAid appliances again if I can help it. Horrendous warranty support experience and a complete lemon of a fridge after just a few years.\n\nHowever, the fidelity and quality of Costco's staff who worked with us and helped us with this terrible experience? Just excellent. They worked with us to find a solution when they could have simply thrown us to the wolves after the 90 day no questions return policy ended.\n\nMark I believe was the manager who helped us but really almost every staff member we work with here is patient, respectful, and kind. The tire department as well! Helped us out with a nail puncture situation and were flexible with scheduling a tire replacement in a way they didn't have to be.\n\nI believe that it's not the everyday situations but the difficult situations that define a company's quality and customer commitment. As long as Costco puts customers first and works with us as they have, I'll continue to find reasons to recommend and shop at them over any competitors. Sam's Club can get stuffed.",

This is a great location right off of Interstate 25 with a ton of parking. There are always carts available and plenty of staff who are always very friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. They always have a HUGE selection of items and will rotate items in and out of stock. They have samples on the weekends and an awesome little food court with really good food for a ridiculously low price. The store is also always very clean and well maintained.",

Long story short, I sent my teenage son (who lives in my home) to Costco to purchase a vacuum. He made it into the store, picked up the item, but was stopped at self checkout like a criminal for not having his own card. I get the membership policy, but is this really what its come to? I can't send my teenage son into a store (I pay to have a membership with) to pick something up? Customers are being treated like criminals because employees can't interpret a policy appropriately? Did this checkout person ever consider that the person in front of them might be a future member? Or that this teenager's family might spend a fair amount of money with Costco every month? I could go into further detail about my follow up conversations with the stores Anti-Membership Manager (Greg) but it would be a waste of time. It's important for everyone to remember, you have a choice of where to spend your hard earned money. No need to be treated poorly in the process.",

Then her and another employee gave us attitude because they don't accept American express HOWEVER there is no posted info on that anywhere in the store so how are people supposed to know what cards they don't accept. If it wasn't for needed this stuff yesterday we would have just walked out. Never had such horrible service there.

Also the rotisserie chicken being $5 is epic.  Food court price wise is like stepping back in time by 15 years, as a hot dog and soda combo costs about $3 and is a wonderful lunch.  As a person with blindness I highly recommend this location.  Staff was well trained, knowledgeable, and helped right away.  I was able to get in and out with some lunch in like 30 minutes and most of that time was spent relaxing and eating.  We all know you will pay a bit more on some items for the discounts on others, but honestly being able to get every thing in one trip with out having to hike up to Walmart is worth every penny.  There are more than enough real discounts on groceries to justify the basic membership",

There is no excuse for that, they should have had adequate numbers of hot dogs prepared for the noon hour. Worst Costco for court service I\u2019ve ever had.",

Additionally, the store's policy of not accepting credit cards added to the inconvenience. Overall, my experience was disappointing, and I cannot recommend this store.",

      "text": "I consider myself a bit of a Costco snob. Unfortunately, the nearest Costco is it a bit of a drive from my home compared to our local Sam's Club. So my review today will take the consideration the competition.\nLet me start by saying I love Costco! Their products are quality, their stores are usually pretty clean (considering how many people shop there), and the employees are very friendly and helpful.  Unlike Sam's Club, they are almost always fully staffed.\n\nWhat I am about to write might be the only thing I don't like about Costco, so here it goes.\n\nI understand how retail stores are trying to save money with the self checkout lines. Costco's is an utter disaster.  The fact that you have to take your heavy, bulk, items out of your cart, scan them, then put them on the scale, then put them back in your cart is unacceptable. It's faster just to go have One of the friendly workers do it for you the old fashioned way.  But you might say, \"but they usually have a worker that can come and scan your heavy items for you!\" If this is the case, then what is the purpose of the self checkout line in the first place?  On top of that, there is usually one worker for every six self-checkout lines and they are almost always trying to help somebody else so it's a complete waste of time.  I do everything in my power to avoid using the self-check outlines at Costco.\n\nIf you've never shopped at Sam's Club, let me tell you about that experience. You have two options.\n\nThe first option is that you can go to the self checkout line, take the scanning gun that is available at each line, scan your items while they are in your cart, pay, have your receipt checked, then leave the store.\n\nThe second option is called Scan and Go. With this option you use an app on your phone to pay for all of your items as you shop, you then pay for everything from your phone, have one of the checkout people scan your electronic receipt to make sure you aren't stealing anything, and leave the store.  It is quick, seamless, and works extremely well. I rarely see long lines at Sam's Club.\n\nCostco, please address this.  You are better than this.  Thanks.",

It\u2019s worth becoming a member, because it\u2019s more than just shopping - it\u2019s a whole community.\n\nCostco has become my go-to destination for all my shopping needs. From groceries to business needs, you name it - Costco has it all. Its unbeatable combination of quality products, great value, convenience, and excellent customer service makes it no brainer to shop here.\n\nIt is also a great place to grab a bite at their cafeteria area. As a busy business bee, I sometimes make my lunch to be a slice of pizza ($3 lunch, nothing can beat that).  And if the lines are not tooo long, I get gas - it\u2019s slightly cheaper as well which is nice \u2728\n\nI highly recommend! \u2728",

The product that is on the shelves are mighty, I learned that if they don't have an item, they just don't have it. Customer culture is fast paced, when you're in the connecting aisles, move fast and get to the isolated aisles so you can browse at your own pace. Spacious, you'll have room to move around but the amount of people that are shopping along side you can make it feel tight. I will return and see if I experience something else.",

I took over 100 photos, but this review system only allows 50 pictures. I did like that there is a gas price sign as you walk out, there are about 6 accessible parking spots. The aisles are sooo wide and there are over 16 aisles of JUST SNACKS! That isn't the case with a regular Costco. MY BEST DEAL: Kings Hawaiian rolls: 16 count, 2 pack(so 32 rolls) , is $6.79 HERE. Because at Cub Foods it's a 12 pack for $4.99! I LOVE this deal here!",

      "text": "Our first trip to the Business Center was interesting. We noticed many unique products and surprised over how different it is from more traditional stores. The variety and volume of products in meat, cheese, paper products, and snacks, is beyond what we expected. That said, we were very disappointed with the quality of the fresh fruit we purchased.\n\nTwo packages of Red grapes were both far beyond what should have been available for sale. When we arrived home we quickly discovered they were incredibly over-ripe, soft, and nearly mush.  Plan to call the store back, but ours were just two from the many pallets of same which were on display for sale. I\u2019m sure there are, and will be many more dissatisfied customers. This is preventable.\n\n** Following up on this post. I tried calling the store numerous times after sharing this feedback. Eventually I gave up having not connected with anyone. Voice message was not returned either. This is absolutely not what we have become accustomed to as Costco customers. In fact, we have always appreciated their focus on customer service, and quality products. Am surprised, disappointed",

There is a abundance of cooking products such as knifes, pans, commercial mixers and ovens. Lots of cleaning products, many more options for beverages, snack type options, also a much larger refrigerated section offering similar options though in more commercial quantities. To be clear it is a very good choice for personal to shop here.\n\nOnly downside is no food court area, likely due to the significantly fewer customers passing through the store at this location.",

Despite this, we were not rushed or hurried, but rather met with an unruffled and patient attitude from the staff.\nFollowing our checkout, we decided to get some food, and what was truly astonishing was the grace with which the staff handled this. They graciously permitted us to dine in, allowing us to enjoy our meal at a relaxed pace, despite the fact that it was significantly past their scheduled closing time. There was a complete absence of impatience or frustration from the staff members. Instead, we were treated with understanding, kindness, and a warm smile, which significantly added to our enjoyment of the evening.\nThis extraordinary experience is a testament to Costco's dedication to customer satisfaction. It wasn't just about staying open late or letting us eat in peace; it was the genuine kindness and patience exhibited by the staff that left a deep impression.\nOn top of this excellent service, the store also boasts some fantastic deals. The wide range of products and their unbeatable prices is another factor that contributes to the unique shopping experience at Costco. It's not just the savings on offer, but the quality of the products available that make shopping here such a pleasure.\nA heartfelt thank you to the staff at this Costco! You embody the spirit of exceptional customer service.",

No matter what location, that's the culture of Costco. I don't deem it a negative thing, nature of the beast type of thing. I also went to purchase a basketball and football. They didn't have it, something to keep in mind when considering Costco. They can have basketball hoops and hockey nets but may not have small items like baseball, depends on the demand. I enjoy Costco because they thoughtfully plan their locations to accommodate a mass group of people. Large parking lots, huge doors, and plenty of product. Another thing I'd like to point out is that the signage is gigantic! You can see the department you're looking for across the store. Staff were friendly. Helped me on multiple occasions. I like this location and will be back to see if I have a difference experience.",

(Shouldn\u2019t be saying this but he assists me with anxiety and panic attacks). When I asked them why I wasn\u2019t allowed to go in, they said that it was because he\u2019s not a trained dog, or a service animal, which he clearly is. They didn\u2019t even want to look at his ID or to see his belt. None of that. I won\u2019t come back to any Costco location, and I will make sure to take this with legal representation because my dog should be allowed anywhere. The manager or the supervisor (I don\u2019t know what she was, sorry) she was super rude, and didn\u2019t even do the right procedure. (Ask for his ID, what type of service animal he was, nothing) absolutely disappointing, never had this problem in a Costco before.",

They messed up both there glasses, so now my kids have to wear each others glasses, they are too tight and one is too loose. It took 4/5 people to get this resolved and they never resolved it. My kids are wearing glasses that fall off and too tight. The manager was annoyed and kept saying she\u2019s past her time she was suppose to leave. My kids do not have spare glasses. I was frustrated . I got home and tried to email/ support for Costco, they said to call manager. I called and all she did was apologize and my kids are on a little over a week without there right glasses. I picked up my kids other glasses today, the lady said nothing. Not friendly staff or good customer  service. I feel like Costco here sucks. Never any issues in Arizona. I need to get new glasses and i don't not think i will get our glasses there. I do not live close to this Costco, I\u2019ve been having to make several trips to get this figured out. I feel like no one at this Costco cares or wants to help resolved it. My kids will be without there glasses for two weeks, i don't even feel like dealing with this Costco/ optometry",

No big deal because I am used to long checkout lines at Costco. When I got to my turn to checkout, the lady at the checkout counter kept on pressuring me upgrade to an executive membership. I told her no thank you, but she kept on pressuring me to upgrade. I just wanted to buy the laptop. Finally, she backed off and I was able to purchase the laptop.

Unfortunately, when I returned to pick up my vehicle, the money was missing.\n\nWhile I acknowledge that forgetting the money was my mistake, I was further frustrated by the lack of professionalism and empathy shown by the employees and managers. I expected a higher level of service and integrity from a reputable establishment like Costco.\n\nI hope that Costco will take steps to address this issue and ensure that their employees are trained to handle customer property with care and respect. I also hope that they will implement measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\nAs a loyal customer, I am disappointed that my trust was breached in this way.

Slowly over the years since Price Club became Costco it has replaced quite a large number of items with Kirkland products but has ALWAYS honored their return policy without question. Until recently! I had purchased 2 sets of windshield wiper blades. One set I used immediately and held on to the second set for future use. During this time I sold the car they fit and obviously forgot about the wiper blades in the garage still in their original packaging. After discovering the product recently I took them into the return department. Although the young lady who helped me was very polite she needed to ask the manager about the return. The so called manager Aaron (who refused to give a last name) refused the return. Also requested a receipt and accused me of possibly buying the item at Walmart and scamming Costco. Turns out that Costco switched vendors from Goodyear to Michelin products. This should not be the customers problem that they can\u2019t get credit for the returned item. Costco corporate may want to address this with their so called manager Aaron(no last name) and possibly send him back through training. Or at least over to the Costco Vision Center so he can read the sign that\u2019s right above the door.",

When I picked up the vehicle, they said that three of the tire sensors were not working with an \u201coh well\u201d attitude. I told them that I have never had an issue with any sensor and they worked perfectly fine before they serviced them as part of the tire installation package. Sure enough, about 15 miles after leaving the store a warning light came on and the vehicle could no longer read pressure on three of the tires. Could one go bad in the three hours they had my vehicle? Highly unlikely, but possible. Could 3? That would be impossible.\n\nIn trying to deal with the shop, they were really snarky and questioned that they were working, sarcastically saying \"this is my question to you since you are my expert, another learning moment for me.\"  I would not expect such an unprovoked lack of respect and professionalism from anyone in any sort of leadership capacity.\n\nAs for the tires, I ended up purchasing a reprogramming tool on Amazon at my expense to reprogram the sensors as the shop should have done in the first place.  Surprise, surprise, my supposedly broken sensors now work just fine.\n\nI've been a member for 20 years and have had nothing but positive experiences at other Costco stores.  If this is what is tolerated by store management, I will take my business elsewhere and am strongly reconsidering my executive membership.  There are more choices in the market.",

Okay\u2026 I thought, then his associate apologized and said how overworked and short staffed they were. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d I said and thought, you can still respond to me, come on!

Honestly wound up buying stuff we never would have thought of just because we were able to taste it. Also we sampled stuff that we didn't like that we were going to buy so I think that is very good I wish other superstores like this did that more often. They're main competitor that we also have membership at very rarely does it anymore. The store overall was very clean and well kept up and constantly stocked with products.

      "text": "This is specifically to address the optical center: in the past, I\u2019ve had nothing but good experiences here. Recently, the place has become impossible, defective, and infuriating. They don\u2019t have enough opticians working to accommodate the number of customers. You have to take a number and wait. They move at a snail\u2019s pace, and seem to be looking for anything else to do instead of helping the people waiting. I dropped off a pair of glasses on March 1 to have new lenses put in. They told me a week and a half, and they\u2019d call.  In the past, this usually meant a week, and I\u2019d get a text. After a week, I was there shopping, and just thought I\u2019d check to see. They wouldn\u2019t even look at me without a number, and there were eight people waiting, so I left. Yesterday, I tried calling, but they weren\u2019t picking up the phone. I called the service desk and the woman actually offered to walk over to see if my glasses were in. Indeed, they were just sitting there! She told me there was eight people in line there and only two opticians and recommended I come later. I decided to be the first one there this morning, and was waiting outside at 9:40. Other people were already there. When that door opened, I literally ran to the optical shop, and there was another woman who ran in through the exit to do the same thing. I beat her to the punch, and got the first number. We sat down in the only two chairs there to wait, as there was no optician there yet. We commiserated, and she had essentially the same story as me, having gone in one day last week at 10:15, only to find eight people ahead of her, and a wait of an hour and a half. She picked up new glasses that had a problem and had to be returned. Well, today when the optician finally arrived, he began puttering around the counter, but avoided dealing with the customers at all costs. Finally, he waved me up. Right out of the box, he commented, \u201cwell, there\u2019s a problem right there.\u201d It turned out that they only put the correct coatings on one lens, but no coatings on the other. The glasses needed to be sent back to the lab. I explained my saga to him and that I\u2019m a pilot who needs correct glasses to fly in the morning. He told me he could offer me express shipping to and from the lab on the West Coast, and that\u2019s great, but it doesn\u2019t help me for tomorrow morning when I have to fly. It also means that I will lose at least another couple of hours to accomplish the simple task of having updated lenses installed in my glasses. Fast forward: when the glasses came back the second time, they had NO COATING ON EITHER LENS! They had to be sent back to the West Coast a third time. I was told they would be expedited. I still don\u2019t have them. As of last night (MAY 2nd!), the manager told me, \u201cyour frames are at the lab. I called and encouraged them to make your lenses.\u201d I began this process when I was still wearing a winter coat. Now I\u2019m wearing shorts and a T-shirt, and I still don\u2019t have my eyeglasses! With this, I have decided that the better prices at the Costco optical center don\u2019t end up saving me anything. With all of the wasted time and trips, and all of the unnecessary aggravation, it\u2019s the same as paying double at LensCrafters. It\u2019s too bad, really. He told me he\u2019s the manager of the optical center and he tells the general manager they need more opticians behind the counter, but that it falls on deaf ears. He asked me to express my frustration in writing to the general manager. I\u2019m using this platform to do just that. I hope they may read this and fix their broken optical center. In the meantime, I may just dispute the charge with my credit card company.",

      "text": "Costco has great prices for many items. It's well worth the membership cost for most things, if you have space to buy in bulk or you have a large family and go through things quickly or need to buy in large quantities. They do sell other items in smaller quantities, clothes, and some fresh foods that benefit anyone. The stock changes up frequently always giving something new to try, while the core items you rely on are usually always available. There are also some great deals on things if you keep an eye out for them.\nThe only thing I'm not a fan of is the constant attention from the employees treating everyone like they are a thief. You have to show your card upon entering the store, before you can check out your products, and your cart is inspected against the receipt on the way out. I understand wanting to reduce shrinkage and membership sharing, but to be frank, that's not my problem as someone who both has a membership and shops with honesty. It reduces the customer experience to be scrutinized when you have not and will not do anything wrong. This is clearly not something that only bothers me, but yet it continues regardless. Maybe if the check happened only once at the register it would be less frustrating and more understandable since it is impossible to check out without a card, even if you walk in the store without one. This is also the only store that I shop at which checks my purchases as I leave.",

I just got back and I\u2019m standing behind the women that told that to my daughter I asked if there was a problem. And she said well I told her she can\u2019t check out. I told the women I said she looks like like the card meaning I\u2019m the one with the membership. The woman rolled her eyes and said go to register 1 right now- demanding.\n\nThis was by far the worst experience I\u2019ve ever had here at this Costco.. my last visit last month Jason (tall male always at check out) was super nice and VERY helpful.

Costco doesn't even have a sign out front on the road. Why?  Very easy to mistakenly turn into Target's parking lot.  Costco needs to at the very least copy Sam's Club.

I'm aware and recognize that Costco has bought the neighboring property to expand their parking lot. However, I think they could improve their parking lot traffic if they had a zone dedicated to mobile orders. I think if Costco was able to figure out how to accomplish that feature, they could not only reduce their carbon footprint, and lower parking lot congestion, but maximize profit margin as well. Maybe they could fence-in part of the downstairs garage with mobile orders? It would help for the people who want a quick in-and-out.",

Afterwards, we went shopping and overall it was a good experience. It was pretty busy but we made it through the store and found what we needed. The prices are great and check out was not bad at all. I'd recommend Costco for anyone looking bulk buying and reasonable prices. Giving this location four out of five stars due to the parking situation.",

Later, I checked the sell-by date at home and found it was 1/7. Consequently, I returned it, but no apology was given. During that time, I noticed another cake box on the shelf with a past sell-by date. Dear Costco, please prioritize checking your product's sell-by dates over inconveniencing customers with multiple document checks (ID and receipts). Even airports with the highest security protocols check documents only twice, whereas Costco checks three times (entry, check out, and exit).",

While there were some positive aspects, there were also a few shortcomings that I couldn't ignore.\nStarting on a positive note, the sheer size of the store is impressive. It's a retail giant with a vast selection of products ranging from electronics and clothing to household essentials and groceries\n\nThe downside of the Costco is they don\u2019t have any label for aisle. So it\u2019s really hard to find product. Which is not a good thing for the customer. Another thing is each step they are looking for their membership card which is kind of annoying.\n\nOverall I like prefer Costco then Bj\u2019s. They have more variety of products but they need some improvements.",

(I don\u2019t partake with the samples)We went to Costco for two items only, Costco disposable toilet tissue wipes.  They didn\u2019t have any!!!  We then went to get half and half.  They didn\u2019t have any!!! I then decided I wanted something sweet, oatmeal raisin and sugar cookies are my favorites. They didn\u2019t have sugar cookies and I had to buy the triple pack just to get a few oatmeal cookies $9.99, price was a little too high. We did purchase the rotisserie chicken which was cooked well, and was delicious.  Then , when it\u2019s time to checkout( self checkout) you are carded before you go use the self checkout.  Then on the way out your receipt is checked to be sure you are not stealing. I definitely do not like the constant monitoring of your identity. But, I do understand it is the company policies that you agree to as a member.",

The only two things I don't really care for is the way traffic is routed to get into the parking lot, it creates a fair amount of congestion, in conjunction with the face most people are busy staring at their phones while driving instead of keeping traffic moving. The place is always a mad house unless you go very early. The people around the bottle returns don't make room for the people coming in and out of the store so it can create backup just trying to get in. Most people are in such a rush inside the store they're more concerned with getting in line front of you than just letting you by. These are not Costo's problems, more people problems, why I still have them 5 stars. I always come prepared with a list and go where I need to and leave as quickly as possible. I do like their gas and am willing to wait in line if I need fuel. Their gas is rated among the top best fuels you can put in your vehicle.",

The store is much cleaner and organized. They have larger selection of products and better quality.\n\nI love the frozen vegetable selection and that they have vegetarian items! Everything is of high quality and I am never disappointed with selections.\n\nMostly, I purchase the gas because top tier. And the price is always much lower than gas at convenient stores. And unlike Sam\u2019s there are plenty of pumps and even if crowded the wait isn\u2019t long. There is also plenty of parking at the store. No such thing as driving around to find a parking space like you tend to at Sam\u2019s.\n\nYesterday my young neighbor accompanied me and he wanted a hot dog. The hot dog is beef plus you get a soda and only $1.50. The hot dog was about 7 or 8 inches long and he said it was very good! The deli is very clean and they also have an ATM machine next to it. While waiting on hot dog the lady made ice cream sundaes for a customer and they looked delicious! I think I may go back today and get one; strawberry!! \ud83d\ude03\n\nAnd they have beautiful Christmas decorations at a very reasonable price. I actually love this store because always so very organized and neat!! I\u2019m OCD \ud83d\ude09\n\nI highly recommend purchasing a membership. You will not be disappointed and just like me; you\u2019ll never return to Sam\u2019s! There is really no competition!!!",

My family is an executive member for many years.  My experience today with George, one of the person that handle free food samples at this location is one of the rare regrettable one.  I took one of the free food samples and ate it.  I like it a lot so I took my little daughter who shopping with my wife in another aisle back to try and see if she likes it too.  The moment George saw me, he yelled at me \u201cyou already tried it, you shouldn\u2019t do it again\u201c in front of everyone.  I told him, that\u2019s uncalled for!  It\u2019s just a small piece of free sample!  Also, there is no sign saying a family can\u2019t take more than one sample.  As a matter of fact, I saw multiple customers took more than one samples at one time and he didn\u2019t say anything to them.  I may came back the second time but it\u2019s still not right for him to embarrass me in front of everyone.  The reason Costco gave out free samples is to get customers buy more,  and that\u2019s how I ended up buying tons of food I didn\u2019t planned to buy multiple times before.  How would it help Costco sell more of anything when you are embarrassed your customers?  Please do better!",

Unfortunately this location is so overcrowded that it's making it difficult for me to continue shopping here.  It appears obvious that they need to open another location in the area to shift some of the demand off of this store. The lines to get gas, checkout, or even get a pizza are so long that I have given up more often, as I just don't have the time.  And the aisles are mobbed with shoppers, making it difficult to move.  If you go to this location, plan accordingly, and allow ample time.",

      "text": "This has been my favorite Costco for years. I even moved down the street & go a few times a week. Unfortunately the past 6+ months, customer service has been awful. Specifically, there is this older woman who works at the customer service desk. I\u2019ve dealt with her 3 times & each time she has basically refused to do her job. Did a return & wanted it put on a shop card so I can use it same day, \u201cI can\u2019t do that\u201d I always do it that way? Did something change? \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d hands me a receipt & motions the next customer. Rude. The other day, my BF wanted to renew our membership in person  because the app wasn\u2019t working & we wanted some stuff anyways. After waiting in line (behind a couple who was also renewing) she told us she couldn\u2019t & wanted us to go to checkout to do it. We were confused & she said she wouldn\u2019t be able to take our payment? Even though we just watched her do it. This was like 2 hours before close & there was no one else near customer service, so it\u2019s not like she was rushing. She just doesn\u2019t want to do her job anytime I see her. Customer service has also gone down at the registers, everyone seems to have such attitudes these days. I really hope they work on it, I\u2019ve been going a lot less & it\u2019s almost not worth it to have the black card anymore.",

Apart from businesses, this is definitely a place to consider going for buying groceries when hosting big parties and with thanksgiving approaching, this is a perfect place for holiday season.  Lot of several meat choices (whole goat, lamb, pig and duck) and several cheese options than what we find at the regular Costco locations.

So no birthday cakes or the famous hot dog here.\nOn the other hand I feed 4 kids. So the business Costco definitely has good stuff for us.\nWorth checking out",

She was talking to me as if my account wasn\u2019t mine and I tried to show her and she kept yelling and saying I need to get out of her line, until a nice lady, assist me and continued on. Very racially manner.  Look at me as if I did not exist.  Service like this make me want to continue to shop with other establishments like Sam\u2019s Club and restaurant Depot. I have been to multiple states with food trucks and never had this experience.  I am mixed raced, and really confused about the situation and general maybe because I look more black with dreadlocks.

I have been a customer at this location for 4 years, and the folks there were always so kind. I had a great shopping experience and could feel the team there was more like a family. After speaking to many of the employees that are there, I see what has happened. New management has taken over and there have been SO many changes, including letting a very valuable team member named Matt go. Apparently he was not the only one, there were more people fired that day for this self pay snack situation. On top of the fact that it is heartbreaking, the NEW staff are RUDE and the entire Vibe in the cash wrap area is anxious and off. I had a lady get very upset that I brought my cooler bags to put my cold items in, she was tossing my food in carelessly and gave me a rude look. I was speechless. I had to go to the tables and re pack it so that it fit and was not a hazard.  The whole store is not the same kind feel that it once was. The NEW people are not friendly at all, and I can not stand how off and cold the vibe is. I can see the managers being short with employees, and employees not even smiling, just looking so down. I hope that corporate sees this and changes things. Bring Matt and the others back and get rid of this new manager!",

So here it goes.\n\nI am beyond irritated that I drove over 40 minutes, specifically for 5 items and apparently they are no longer carrying those items. But then again, some of them may be there but it's like an Easter egg hunt with them CONSTANTLY changing items locations around.  One example...Trying to find the baby formula...guess where it was located? Not with the other baby items but next to the Pharmacy. What?! That's like going in to buy toilet paper and finding it next to the refrigerated produce.\n\nThey also do not LABEL aisles to find things easily (like Sam's does). Maybe that's a marketing trick so that you will spend more time looking and spend more money by seeing other things. That just ticks me off. Besides, with the Scan-n-go at Sam's Club... that's a game changer.",

The incident that prompted this review occurred on the 8th of this month at approximately 1:20 pm. A light greenish-blue Volvo, driven by one of their employees, recklessly entered the parking lot as if rushing to make it to their shift on time. The driver's aggressive maneuvering nearly resulted in a collision with our vehicle. Despite our attempts to alert him with a honk, he responded with a rude gesture using his middle finger before hastily parking.\n\nFurthermore, the recent policies implemented by the store have added unnecessary inconvenience to the shopping experience. Since October, customers are not only required to present identification upon entry but are also asked to produce the same card again during checkout. This redundant procedure, coupled with the mandatory inspection of receipts upon departure, fosters an environment that feels distrustful and unwelcoming. No customer should feel like a criminal simply for patronizing a store.\n\nWhile I understand the importance of security measures, the implementation here feels excessive and disrespectful to loyal customers. Personally, I find the shopping experience at other establishments, such as Sam's, to be far more accommodating and respectful of customer privacy. Unless there are significant improvements in both customer service and policies, I regret to say that I will be taking my business elsewhere.",

The Kirkland brands are really good compared to the more well-known name brands.  The self-checkout has helped but it can still take some time to get out of the store, especially during peak hours.  The samples are good and the restaurant is a nice stop on the way out but it can get busy too.  Overall a good store and I will visit it again.",

You will be amazed by their \u2018value for money\u2019. Also Costco products are of very good quality, including the food section. I love their salads or tacos, or ribs, etc. It\u2019s huge in size but very affordable good meal. Our Costco experience is always good. This location is just another usual one. If you are a Costco member, visit this location. This one was very neat and clean and organized one, at least during my visit. If you are not a member, I highly recommend you to buy the basic membership ( worth of 60$ yearly). This is a very good investment.",

I Thought I got a pretty good deal,  but NOW, after a month, and several issues, I can't EVER get Any Help.\nThey gave me a Costco VIP number - to some in Africa. They say Don't go to the store - but we did, because we couldn't get help from the Costco people, or that REDICULOUS pune number, then the stores seemed butt hurt, because we went to Costco.\nI'm Frustrated, and Mad, and disappointed that, so far, the customer service, is about what I had with Verizon.\nI got a \"discount\" through the company I work for, but they \"Accidently\" put the wrong company in for that discount, and want me to prove I work for a place I Don't work, and now I'm jumping for through a thousand hoops to fix Their mistakes, but they Can't Help me.\nI probably will never go back to Verizon, but I sure didn't get the deal I thought I got through at&t Costco. I'm pretty screwed. I just want to be able to ask someone for some damn help, and they have been terrible.",

I'm so glad there is a Costco close buy to us. It saves us on groceries for sure. If you have a big family, or if you like to buy in bulk. Costco is great. You do have to have a membership to shop at the store. It is well worth it. There is more than just groceries, too. Good place to look for winter jackets. They carry wool socks. And they have household items as well. It is not a one stop shop but they definitely have a good selection.",

I don't know what happened recently, but Costco seems understaffed based on the workers' stress levels and also the state of the food court (trash everywhere, empty tables covered in condiments, and everything at the self service station as well as sodas being out of stock).\n\nEdit: Well, it's gotten significantly worse. This store is consistently busy and yet management has decided the solution is cutting back store and employee hours. I think the solution is probably a lot closer to paying a livable wage, since your employees are clearly miserable (and I KNOW the wage isn't livable due to having family who applied).",

He understood why I felt bullied and uncomfortable yet GARY still works there.. wow zero stars\n\nCostco south Arlington- Monday 1/29/24- 1:25pm.  I was in and out of the store with no problem as I purchased three items. I am here frequently just to buy a rotisserie chicken and usually have a good experience. Today, as I was attempting to leave the parking lot, a lot attendant pushed a row of carts toward my car, then stopped in front of my car. There was no obvious reason for why he was doing this. he stopped the row of carts about 1 inch from my bumper, so close that my sensors were beeping in my car. I honked, and he refused to move, even propped up 1 foot, took out his phone and began  scrolling on his phone as if to tell me, I would be the one moving, not him.  I was on the correct side of the parking aisle and had nowhere to go and believe this employee was blatantly disrespecting me and made me feel extremely uncomfortable. His name is GARY.  I hope someone explains to Gary where his paycheck comes from.  And encourages him to work on his approach to customers.   I will drive across town to go to a different Costco.",

It has a different layout compared to the Costco where I normally shop but with the help of employees plus another shopper I found most of the items on my list. The \"express\" line was long but moved quickly. One suggestion, have a Costco employee at each of the self checkouts to scan everything. I was used to the scanning the customers used to be able to do, so my cart is always arranged with the bar codes up. It makes it easy and fast for all.",

There is always a full supply of all items and the people who work there all appear to be happy and friendly.\n\nOne of the things that I really like about this particular Costco is that the meat and seafood seems to always be in really great stock. I think the director at this store must be a really dedicated guy.\n\nOne other thing I've noticed is that the people who work in the front of store have been around for a long time. There are familiar faces here. That makes a difference.\n\nOther than that, it's got all the great stuff and things you would expect from the Costco franchise, great prices, products and large quantities. I'm a big fan of Costco and definitely have come to geeatly appreciate my membership over the years. I highly recommend Costco and only give this particular one 4 stars because it's so busy and crowded. Clicking the like button will not hurt my feelings! \ud83d\ude09",

      "text": "Tire center:\nI have yet to have a good experience at the tire center here. I have two main issues:\n1. I easily spend twice or more time here than anywhere else for similar service\n2. They did not own up to $385 of damage they caused to my car\n\nMore details:\n1. The most common problem I've had is how much time I waste even though I always have an appointment. (The difficulty of getting one is another matter) Dropping off? Wait 20 minutes in line. Picking up? Wait 20 minutes...  (or longer) Maybe I'm just plagued with always picking a bad time to go in, but seems unlikely, especially when I always have an appointment.  Work times are also considerably longer than other places I've done business with. My best case scenario when I've gotten a tire fixed was about an hour and a half. I've also waited almost 3 hours before.\n\n2. They did not own up to their negligence and the damage they caused to my car. I had tires installed at this Costco on an Odyssey with 200k miles. When I got my tires rotated the first time, one of the lug nuts was stripped on a wheel stud and broke off. Any mechanic will tell you this is the fault of the person who last put the lug nuts on: they didn't take the time to thread it by hand initially and just forced it on with an impact wrench. Obvious negligence on Costco's part. I had to fill out a form about the damage (after waiting in line 20+ min...), then deal with a 3rd party with lots of back and forth conversations. They denied the claim because their excuse was they said wheel studs are supposed to be replaced at 100k miles as part of normal maintenance! That isn't in the manual and several mechanics I spoke to had never heard of that (including the Frisco Honda dealership). Costco's representative wouldn't budge. When I asked for documentation to prove what they were telling me, they blew me off. The only thing I can think of where they are getting the 100k mile number is that is when the wheel studs are out of warranty. By that logic, if they crashed my car into the wall they wouldn't pay for that either since the entire car is out of warranty. I had to get the wheel stud replaced for $385 - one of the cheapest quotes I found. Assuming it is negligible to replace the other studs on the same wheel, according to Costco, you are supposed to spend $1600 to have all your wheel studs replaced at 100k miles. Absurd I had to pay for Costco's negligence.\n\nI'll never give Costco my tire business again, even for work that might entail using the warranty and should be \"free\".",

      "text": "I recently had a shopping experience at Costco, and I must say it was quite impressive.\n\nThe first thing that struck me was the incredible variety of products available. From groceries to electronics, furniture to clothing, Costco seems to have it all. Whether you're shopping for your household or business needs, you're likely to find what you're looking for.\n\nCostco's membership model may deter some, but I found it to be well worth it. The savings from bulk buying can be substantial. While individual item prices might seem a bit higher, the overall value for larger quantities is excellent. I've found that the annual membership fee more than pays for itself through the savings I've accrued.\n\nThe quality of products at Costco is generally top-notch. They carry reputable brands, and their Kirkland Signature private label often offers a more affordable option without compromising on quality.\n\nOne highlight of my visit was the food court. Costco's food offerings are both delicious and budget-friendly. The famous hot dogs and pizza slices are well worth the visit alone.\n\nCustomer service at Costco is impressive. The return policy is generous, and the staff members are consistently helpful and friendly. It's a welcoming environment that adds to the overall positive shopping experience.\n\nWhile the stores can get crowded, especially on weekends, it's a testament to Costco's popularity. However, I appreciate that they've made strides in improving their online shopping experience for those who prefer to shop from home.\n\nI also commend Costco for its sustainability efforts, including commitments to sourcing sustainable products and reducing its environmental impact. It's reassuring to see a big retailer taking steps toward a more eco-friendly future.\n\nIn conclusion, Costco offers a comprehensive shopping experience with its wide product selection, membership benefits, and excellent savings on bulk items. The quality of products and customer service is commendable, and the food court is a delightful bonus. While the membership fee and crowds may not be for everyone, I find that the benefits far outweigh any drawbacks. Costco continues to be a top choice for my shopping needs.",

I still had some tread remaining but was going on a road trip and thought I should have them replaced.\n\nI called the store and worked through the phone system to reach the tire section.   After a couple of days of ringing them  several times each day I selected the option to talk with Admin.\n\nAdmin informed me that my best option was to come into the store, select and pay for tires, and finally to make an appointment for installation.   Basically two trips. Admin then said I could leave a message and the tire section would call me back, I could order the tires, schedule an installation appointment and be done.\n\nI'm still waiting on them to call me back after 5 days.   In the meantime I called Discount Tire, had them ordered and installed three days ago.   And...  Discount Tire was even cheaper by a few dollars.\n\nNormally I believe Costco has fantastic customer service, but apparently it hasn't spread to the tire section.",

      "text": "Worst Costco Location!\nAmy at this location is the worst Costco employee I have ever met. According to your supervisor, you are the only Amy works at this location at today 4/11/2024. My following comments are for you: During the check-out time, me and my friend, who each individually have a separate Costco membership, asked you if we could do two separate transactions since we are sharing our shopping cart. After our request, you started to THROW all the products that you had put on checkout line back to our cart, VERY RUDE. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL. After you threw all the things back to the cart you said:\u201d OK now you can do your two separate check out!\u201d, and you just ran away, disappeared. I was so shocked that I couldn\u2019t say a word at that moment. I have never experienced anything like this at any Costco locations that I have been in North America. Then your supervisor talked to us and apologized several times for your rude and unprofessional behavior which your supervisor assured it\u2019s totally unacceptable and against Costco\u2019s culture and value. If you wanted to be in the customer service job that you need to take what it needs to. I understand you might have a bad day, but again this is not an excuse that you can throw things rudely at any customers shopping cart.\n\nIn addition, I have bought strawberries already have molds of fruits just went bad in a box at this location a few times, which never happened to any other Costco locations. I have been a Costco member for more than 10 years. Today it\u2019s the worst experience ever. I hope you can educate your employees to make sure they know and act the same standard for all your locations.",

I thought you need to have a business, but nope, they welcome everyone!\n\nThis location is so hidden that the way to the parking lot was through some small streets and potholes. It felt like they don't want regular shoppers to know about them unless you really search it up. I never heard of a Costco Business Center until my mom wanted crab meats, and regular Costco doesn't sell them. The online website said they sell them, but you need to order $250 worth of food to get free shipping. I don't need that much food so I decided to visit the location myself.\n\nI was surprised to see all the amazing snacks and drinks that they offer. The selection is huge!! They have all kinds of chocolates, beef jerky, drinks, chips, and more. They don't have a food court, tire center, gas station, or alcohol sections like the regular Costco since it's catered to businesses mainly. I was able to stock up on some snacks that I didn't know Costco offered, and also canned crab meats for my mom. The store is the same size as a regular Costco, but less crowded.\n\nIf you're looking for pantry snacks and groceries, I would highly recommend coming here. Prices are the same as regular Costco, they just have more variety and bulk. They even have a whole lamb for sale in the freezer section. Check-out was super fast because there was barely anyone on a weekday.",

I like Costco better than Sam's Club.  I just bought a commercial grade basic deli meat slicer from a local restaurant equipment supplier; I plan to buy bulk deli meats like ham and turkey, and bulk cheese like sharp Cheddar, Monterey Jack, and Provolone in 5 or 6 pound packs.  Their selection is very limited, BUT the few deli products they have are very high quality and at a reasonable and competitive price.  They have PASTRAMI, and deli turkey that has no antibiotics with only turkey breast, broth, and a tiny amount of sea salt and sugar for the ingredients.  THIS IS A SHORT LIST.  Why buy deli meats and cheese in bulk?  You can save a good amount of money, and freeze what you don't use within a week or 2.  Compared to the prices of a deli at a grocery store, you can save from 50% to 70% off per pound.  The savings vary depending upon what retail price you compare with the same kind of wholesalers deli product.  I decided what kinds of meat and cheese I want, and did the math to find out what my savings would be.  What would cost me $276 at a certain grocery store deli near me will cost me $104 at the Costco Buisiness Center.   This is a $170 savings!  COSTCO BUISINESS CENTER WILL BE MY FIRST PLACE TO GO FOR DELI FOOD BULK PRODUCTS.  Also will buy candy here for Halloween, Christmas, Valentines Day, Easter, and year round.",

Aisles are clear and the store is clean.  Great selections and most retail pricing is aggressive.   Access to check out is good, Costco opens additional che Louis when too many people are in line.  One issue is the food court.  Great pricing on prepared foods but the addition of a remote kiosk for ordering is not well thought out.  By having both a remote order location and a cash aisle that is manned by the server, the cash aisle gets preference.   The line of people waiting for remote orders builds while the cash customers are handled.  Bad system, better when everything was done from one location.    Getting out of Costco can be a problem having stood in line to pay having another line to stand in to get out of the store can be a problem.  Still hold with 5 star, good place to shop",

I easily spend twice or more time here than anywhere else for similar service\n2. They did not own up to $385 of damage they caused to my car\n\nMore details:\n1. The most common problem I've had is how much time I waste even though I always have an appointment. (The difficulty of getting one is another matter) Dropping off? Wait 20 minutes in line. Picking up? Wait 20 minutes...  (or longer) Maybe I'm just plagued with always picking a bad time to go in, but seems unlikely, especially when I always have an appointment.  Work times are also considerably longer than other places I've done business with. My best case scenario when I've gotten a tire fixed was about an hour and a half. I've also waited almost 3 hours before.\n\n2. They did not own up to their negligence and the damage they caused to my car. I had tires installed at this Costco on an Odyssey with 200k miles. When I got my tires rotated the first time, one of the lug nuts was stripped on a wheel stud and broke off. Any mechanic will tell you this is the fault of the person who last put the lug nuts on: they didn't take the time to thread it by hand initially and just forced it on with an impact wrench. Obvious negligence on Costco's part. I had to fill out a form about the damage (after waiting in line 20+ min...), then deal with a 3rd party with lots of back and forth conversations. They denied the claim because their excuse was they said wheel studs are supposed to be replaced at 100k miles as part of normal maintenance! That isn't in the manual and several mechanics I spoke to had never heard of that (including the Frisco Honda dealership). Costco's representative wouldn't budge. When I asked for documentation to prove what they were telling me, they blew me off. The only thing I can think of where they are getting the 100k mile number is that is when the wheel studs are out of warranty. By that logic, if they crashed my car into the wall they wouldn't pay for that either since the entire car is out of warranty. I had to get the wheel stud replaced for $385 - one of the cheapest quotes I found. Assuming it is negligible to replace the other studs on the same wheel, according to Costco, you are supposed to spend $1600 to have all your wheel studs replaced at 100k miles. Absurd I had to pay for Costco's negligence.\n\nI'll never give Costco my tire business again, even for work that might entail using the warranty and should be \"free\".",

      "text": "I recently had a shopping experience at Costco, and I must say it was quite impressive.\n\nThe first thing that struck me was the incredible variety of products available. From groceries to electronics, furniture to clothing, Costco seems to have it all. Whether you're shopping for your household or business needs, you're likely to find what you're looking for.\n\nCostco's membership model may deter some, but I found it to be well worth it. The savings from bulk buying can be substantial. While individual item prices might seem a bit higher, the overall value for larger quantities is excellent. I've found that the annual membership fee more than pays for itself through the savings I've accrued.\n\nThe quality of products at Costco is generally top-notch. They carry reputable brands, and their Kirkland Signature private label often offers a more affordable option without compromising on quality.\n\nOne highlight of my visit was the food court. Costco's food offerings are both delicious and budget-friendly. The famous hot dogs and pizza slices are well worth the visit alone.\n\nCustomer service at Costco is impressive. The return policy is generous, and the staff members are consistently helpful and friendly. It's a welcoming environment that adds to the overall positive shopping experience.\n\nWhile the stores can get crowded, especially on weekends, it's a testament to Costco's popularity. However, I appreciate that they've made strides in improving their online shopping experience for those who prefer to shop from home.\n\nI also commend Costco for its sustainability efforts, including commitments to sourcing sustainable products and reducing its environmental impact. It's reassuring to see a big retailer taking steps toward a more eco-friendly future.\n\nIn conclusion, Costco offers a comprehensive shopping experience with its wide product selection, membership benefits, and excellent savings on bulk items. The quality of products and customer service is commendable, and the food court is a delightful bonus. While the membership fee and crowds may not be for everyone, I find that the benefits far outweigh any drawbacks. Costco continues to be a top choice for my shopping needs.",

After a couple of days of ringing them  several times each day I selected the option to talk with Admin.\n\nAdmin informed me that my best option was to come into the store, select and pay for tires, and finally to make an appointment for installation.   Basically two trips. Admin then said I could leave a message and the tire section would call me back, I could order the tires, schedule an installation appointment and be done.\n\nI'm still waiting on them to call me back after 5 days.   In the meantime I called Discount Tire, had them ordered and installed three days ago.   And...  Discount Tire was even cheaper by a few dollars.\n\nNormally I believe Costco has fantastic customer service, but apparently it hasn't spread to the tire section.",

My following comments are for you: During the check-out time, me and my friend, who each individually have a separate Costco membership, asked you if we could do two separate transactions since we are sharing our shopping cart. After our request, you started to THROW all the products that you had put on checkout line back to our cart, VERY RUDE. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL. After you threw all the things back to the cart you said:\u201d OK now you can do your two separate check out!\u201d, and you just ran away, disappeared. I was so shocked that I couldn\u2019t say a word at that moment. I have never experienced anything like this at any Costco locations that I have been in North America. Then your supervisor talked to us and apologized several times for your rude and unprofessional behavior which your supervisor assured it\u2019s totally unacceptable and against Costco\u2019s culture and value. If you wanted to be in the customer service job that you need to take what it needs to. I understand you might have a bad day, but again this is not an excuse that you can throw things rudely at any customers shopping cart.\n\nIn addition, I have bought strawberries already have molds of fruits just went bad in a box at this location a few times, which never happened to any other Costco locations. I have been a Costco member for more than 10 years. Today it\u2019s the worst experience ever. I hope you can educate your employees to make sure they know and act the same standard for all your locations.",

      "text": "Costco's Self-Checkout Nightmare: A Customer Inconvenience Taken Too Far\n\nAs a longtime Costco member, I've always appreciated the warehouse club's commitment to providing value and convenience to its customers. However, their recent changes to the self-checkout process have left me utterly disappointed and questioning their priorities.\n\nThe new self-checkout system is an absolute nightmare for shoppers. Instead of streamlining the checkout process, Costco has made it an unnecessarily arduous and time-consuming ordeal. Customers are now forced to remove every single item from their cart, scan them one by one, place them in a designated weight area, and then painstakingly reload their cart. It's a ridiculous and counterintuitive process that defeats the purpose of self-checkout entirely.\n\nIf Costco's primary concern is theft prevention, they should address it through alternative means rather than inconveniencing and frustrating their loyal customer base. We, as paying members, should not be burdened with such an inefficient and cumbersome checkout process.\n\nCostco has two reasonable options to rectify this situation:\n\nOffer a discount or incentive to customers who endure the self-checkout ordeal. If they insist on making our lives more difficult, the least they could do is provide some form of compensation for our patience and cooperation.\n\nHire more employees to assist with the checkout process. This would alleviate the need for the overly complicated self-checkout system and provide a more efficient and pleasant shopping experience for everyone involved.\n\nCostco prides itself on being a customer-centric company, but these recent changes to the self-checkout process contradict that very principle. It's time for the warehouse giant to reevaluate their priorities and consider the convenience and satisfaction of their loyal members. Failure to address this issue promptly may drive customers away and tarnish Costco's reputation as a shopper-friendly establishment.",

When I applied in store, I needed to call to verify for the application to go through and she was very patient while I was on the phone. She gave me two bags which one bad came with portable dog water bowl.\n\nI was super excited to shop with the temporary card with executive membership. However, the self checkout attendant an old man was not attentive. I needed assistance for alcohol purchase and they did not come help until someone noticed the blinking light while I gave them eye contacts to give help. This is why I left a 4 star review.",

      "text": "\u201cMixed Experience at Costco Lewisville, TX: A Filipino's Oasis with a Checkout Twist\"\n\nAs someone who grew up in the Philippines, discovering Costco in Lewisville, TX felt like finding a piece of heaven. This location stands out with its diverse array of Asian products, a delightful surprise not found in other Costco branches like Southlake, TX. The food court's double chocolate chunk cookies were a sweet revelation, absent in my usual Costco haunt.\n\nHowever, my recent visit on a Sunday around 2 pm left a bittersweet taste. While I've never encountered a rude Costco employee anywhere else, this particular visit had its challenges. The checkout process was chaotic, whether opting for self-checkout or the regular lanes. The long lines seemed exacerbated by a thorough, time-consuming examination of purchases, especially at the regular checkouts. Perhaps it was a long day for the employee in question, but the extended wait after a tiring shopping spree was less than ideal.\n\nDespite the minor hiccup, my love for Costco remains intact, and I'll continue exploring new locations \u2013 just maybe not this one on a Sunday afternoon. The Lewisville branch holds its unique charm, but efficiency at the checkout could use a boost to make the experience truly heavenly.",

The store wasn't too crowded, and the amount of options was pretty crazy in a good way. The prices for many items, at least at this location, weren't cheaper than a comparable item at Sam's Club. I know because as I was shopping, I was comparing prices. We went to check out, and I saw the line, which was back to the frozen food section. You could easily spend just as much time waiting to checkout as you do shopping. They also cannot order online and pick up at the store except for expensive items like electronics or jewelry. Costco just isn't worth the trouble. I would definitely try Sam's Club. Their scan-and-go is a game changer. Costco needs to get with the times it's 2024, not 1924.",

Feel safe about grabbing a slice of pizza, rotisserie chicken, or their delicious freshly packed salads!

It is very annoying and very frustrating for shoppers like myself who have been going to this Costco for years. This has been the worst yet. Today, I went through the self check out line and there was no one there to help me scan my groceries when there usually is. After I had waved my hand to ask the cashier KJ to help me she scanned just a few items and left me there with all other bulk groceries. I again asked her if she could help me scan the rest and she very rudely made me told me that there were other customers, which I understand. However there were other employees thoroughly helping other customers, which made me question why she couldn\u2019t help me with the rest of my groceries. It was also the way that she said it to me after I have been loyal to this Costco for years, it made me feel upset. Costco keeps changing their policies and cutting costs and driving their customers away\u2026 why have a self check out if there\u2019s no scanner guns for BULK groceries, and also no one there who wants to help me! Make it make sense! Sams club is looking better and better.",

      "text": "Disappointing Experience at Costco Checkout\n\nI'm compelled to share a recent disappointing experience at Costco, which has left me reconsidering my membership. After completing our shopping and proceeding through checkout, my elderly mother and I were heading towards the exit when we were stopped for a routine receipt check\u2014an expected procedure at Costco. To our surprise, the employee discovered that a box of bleach bottles had been inadvertently left unscanned, sitting unnoticed at the bottom of our cart. It was clear that this oversight happened during the checkout process, involving both the employees who handled our items and the cashier.\n\nThe staff member at the exit pointed out the missed item and suggested we return to the checkout to pay for it. Under normal circumstances, this might not have been a significant issue. However, given that I was assisting my elderly mother, returning through the busy store presented an inconvenient challenge, particularly to rectify an error we had no hand in creating.\n\nIn an attempt to resolve the situation swiftly, I requested that the item simply be removed from our cart, highlighting that the mistake was on Costco\u2019s part as they managed the checkout process. The response from the employee was unexpectedly defensive; she insisted she had not made a personal error. I had to clarify that it was a systemic oversight by Costco, not her individually. This exchange was discomforting and made us feel wrongfully implicated in the oversight.\n\nWhile I understand that errors can occur, the way this situation was handled lacked empathy and customer care. We left feeling frustrated and significantly inconvenienced, tarnishing our otherwise regular positive experiences with Costco. Effective customer service should prioritize quick and compassionate resolutions. Sadly, this was not our experience, leading me to question the value of my continued patronage with Costco.",

On this particular day, we were on a tight schedule, so my wife went to get gas while I started shopping. I was about 2/3 of the way through the store when she joined me. Even though it was crowded, most Costco shoppers are polite and let me and my cart slip by them easily. And amazingly the checkout lines were short. As usual the staff were efficient and also friendly. And as usual, we found more great buys than we planned (\"the most expensive vehicle to operate is a Costco shopping cart\").",

I have tried to stay away from the prepackaged foods because they always seem to have a lot of extra calories and make me feel chubby after eating. The new pre-packaged items like the Tuscan chicken wraps and chicken sandwiches with Dijon mustard are excellent.\n\nI usually get the executive membership and it typically pays me back $300 so it's well worth the $120 fee.\n\nThis is a great location with a lot of hard-working people!",

We went inside, because you have to go in and get your picture taken for the costco card, not like their competitor, where I just signed up online and was good to go. At first the lady who helped us was cool, but after only offering us the expensive membership for $120, her tone subtly shifted when I asked about the cheaper option she completely left out. She then tried to  explain how the wholesale retail concept works, and I explained we had a Competitor membership and were familiar with how it worked. \"We're nothing like them\" she said. We paid for our membership, and were told we must sign up for auto renewal. She had issues with the tablet used to sign up for this. The tablet then had issues recognizing the card we were using, the same one we just paid for the membership with. and then finally, the app doesn't allow you to add to the cart by scanning, or allow you to checkout using the app. So she was right, nothing like their competitors. The pricing is better here though, and this is probably a one-off experience with them, but as my first experience, I didn't enjoy being talked to as if I was stupid, nor did I like having to repeatedly turn down a more expensive membership.",

I wanted to make sure the diamond earrings I wanted was in perfect condition before I had purchase it. Manny and Olive went beyond my expectations showing me the same pairs of earrings from another area that was not shown in the displayed case. I am very pleased with their services they had provided me. In the end, I had made the purchase. Now we both have the same identical diamond earrings. Sooooo happy !! If I had a choice, I would have given them both a 12/10 on a scale. Keep up the great work !!! \ud83d\udc4d",

The new, new one lasted six months. I took it back and they want to charge me a prorated amount on the price of a new one which has gone way up. If a 36 month battery will only last 6 months there should be no charge for a replacement. It should be handed over with a \"Sorry about that man\" It's very difficult dealing with a dead battery.

Well, the food court employees aren't terrific at customer service but I can imagine how stressful their job is. So, the food court aside, the employees across the board are so pleasant. Costco is just a fun place to shop. There's always stuff you don't need but end up purchasing. There's always stuff they don't have and you wish they did. We shop at Costco for rags for our business, for ginormous muffins and almond danishes, for 500 rolls of toilet paper and never-ending tubes of aluminum foil, for the cauliflower rice and grilled cheese sandwiches. If I get a chance to walk through the clothing section, I'm a happy woman. If I get a chance to buy something from the clothing section without my husband protesting, I'm an even happier woman! I wouldn't say Costco is necessary for our shopping. But we sure are glad we get to shop there!",

This place is like a treasure trove for food enthusiasts and anyone in the food business.\n\nRight off the bat, the selection here is something else. I'm talking about a range of meats and cheeses that you just don't see at other Costco locations. It's like walking into a carnivore's paradise. I even stumbled upon a whole lamb and some seriously impressive Wagyu steaks \u2013 items you don't typically find in a regular warehouse.\n\nBut the real star of the show is their meat, dairy, and produce room. It's enormous \u2013 seriously, the biggest I've ever seen. You can tell they've put a lot of thought into offering a wide variety for both personal and business needs.\n\nWhat's cool about this place is that it's the only Costco Business Center in Houston, which adds to its uniqueness. And the cherry on top? It's not overcrowded. You can actually take your time browsing without feeling rushed or cramped.\n\nHonestly I love the Costco Business Center in Missouri City and this is for sure a fantastic find. Whether you're stocking up for your business or just a food lover looking for quality and variety, this place has got you covered. Definitely worth a visit for a unique and satisfying shopping experience! \ud83d\uded2\ud83e\udd69\ud83e\uddc0\ud83d\udc4d",

They are human.\n\nI located a gentlemen who seemed to be in management, Donnie, and mentioned that the food court might could use some help. Not only did Donnie address the issue immediately, he did so with a great attitude. Within a minute, the food court had three additional employees. The clear and obvious leader of the team in that kitchen was Ms. Allison. She was hustling, knocking out orders with enthusiasm, and set the tone for the rest of them. This experience was highlighted even further with the fact that Donnie came back to check on his team and his customers not once, not twice, but THREE MORE TIMES before we left.\n\nThat is leadership and teamwork at its very best. Thank you, Donnie & Allison. Fine job!",

The Jose grinders are much better.\nThose grinders do a poor job. My EXTRA FINE  grind was way TOO CHUNKY. SEE PHOTO compared to regular Folgers.\nOther Costcos have wide tape in a tape dispenser to reseal the bag. Since this store didn't have it, some of my coffee grinds spilled out going home.\nThe paint brush to sweep the coffee beans was ok. Most Costcos use a steel spin.\nAll things considered, I'm not buy whole bean coffee at this store again.",

Their attitudes, politeness, and customer service have gone in the toilet...  some of them are aggressively rude. I LOVE Costco but it may be time to abandon the Katy location for Bunker Hill or Sugarland. I have never experienced these issues while shopping there.\n\nOn top of this they insist on putting samples at nearly every third end cap (pictured) so when people wait for the attendant to finish making whatever they are giving away it inevitably clogs the isles with not only the people waiting for their sample but everyone trapped behind them. It seriously buggers up people's movement throughout the store and God forbid there was an actual emergency, it would definitely cause a safety hazard.",

The only thing I don't like, which applies to all Costcos, is that I have to show my membership card at the front. I know it is policy; I rarely ever was bothered until recently. I tend to not pull out my card till I get to the door, so it is not something someone can just rush up and take out of my hand. Yet I don't like to take time and hold up the line by digging it out at the door. I also don't like that the only purpose of the person at the entrance is to ask for my membership card. There is little to zero greeting or friendliness. I also don't know why it matters, because I could have stolen the card. Unless it is verified to be my card and not expired, just flashing it quickly does no good for anyone at Costco or the customers. I was told recently that the employees at the self checkout must verify our membership ID. As it turns out, this is false. After speaking with managers about it, they just want to make sure everyone has their card out ready, because they have a problem with customers being efficient. Plus, when I do show them my card they make a useless glance at it, unable to actually discern it is mine.",

The letdown was in the personnel. I can only describe them as \"less than enthusiastic\". Everyone almost seemed miserable, like they hated their jobs. No \"hi\", no acknowledgment, no smiles, nothing. The 2 employees that were at the checkout did seem to enjoy talking to each other while heading customers through the line. The girl who checked our receipts at the door was the worst, not one word, no eye contact, and just went through the motions. I have been a member at Costco for over 10 years, and we shop here every week, this was the worst personal experience. I have come to expect more than this from Costco, but they fell short. It felt like I was shopping ar Sam's.",

The bulk-buying model, which is central to Costco's appeal, allows customers to save significantly on everyday essentials, from groceries to household items.\n\nOne of the standout features of Costco is its quality and variety. The Kirkland Signature brand, exclusive to Costco, is often praised for offering high-quality products at lower prices compared to national brands. Additionally, Costco's selection includes everything from fresh produce and electronics to clothing and furniture, making it a one-stop shop for many consumers.\n\nThe membership model, while an upfront cost, typically pays for itself through the savings members enjoy over time. Members also benefit from services like pharmacy, optical, and photo centers, as well as travel and insurance deals.\n\nCustomer service at Costco is generally commendable. The staff are usually helpful, and the company\u2019s return policy is notably generous, allowing for a hassle-free shopping experience.\n\nOne of the drawbacks is that Costco can be quite busy, especially on weekends, leading to crowded aisles and longer checkout lines. Additionally, the bulk sizes may not be practical for smaller households or those with limited storage space.",

The mattress  is comfortable and  feels exactly Stears and Fosters but has a strong mildew odor, irritates my throat and slightly my eyes while I am sleeping. Wait for a 5 days to see the smells goes away, but it still lingering on the mattress. Called Costco for exchange, they confirmed my next delivery will be March 16 last week. Today they said I may have to wait until January 2025.  They scheduled last night to pick up the mattress for today.  Customer service confirmed that they will bring a new mattress  to exchange for the smell one on my bed. 45 min later the guys came to pick up the mattress(but didn't bring new Mattress). Where do I supposedly sleep without mattress?. Hate to say,  a terrible experience with Costco.",

They told him the info on the prescription (why he was taking it, for pain) was bogus, told us they would not fill it and told us we should leave the store right now. They were aggressive. We never did anything to get that sort of treatment.  Super, super rude. Stopped at customer service for a refund of joining fee, which they gave, and then advised Federal Law says you can't charge a fee to access a pharmacy.

Always prompt and courteous customer service.\n\nHowever, I have been on the receiving end of EXCEPTIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE two times in two months by Devon in the tire center.  Tire purchases include road hazard.  I have gone years without a flat, but in the last two months I had a bolt and a screw in two different driver side tires. Devon in the tire center happened to one to help me both times, lucky for me.  He gave exceptional service both times. The first time I was heading out of town in a day and needed it checked beforehand. He was able to get me in, determine it had a leak and get it fixed before my trip. BIG THANKS!\n\nThe second time was Saturday, 1/27/24, my tire was flat when I came out in the morning.  They were booked on appointments until Tuesday.  I was able to swap my spare and bring the flat tire in and leave it in as a walk in customer between appointments.  They were able to squeeze my repair in within 1-2 hours. I really appreciated this because I didn\u2019t have to deal with it during the week with heavier traffic, work schedule, etc.\n\nThanks again to Devon and his exceptional customer service!\n\nAnd for the bonus points, here\u2019s pics of a flat tire. And one photo credit to JB. \ud83e\udd23",

Listen.. people like me work Monday through Friday so our only time to shop is Friday night through Sunday night. That's when we need to be here. The seniors can shop any day of the week. So this store should get them in there Monday through Thursday offer them some discounts or special food or anything. Clear out the weekend so we can get in there and get what we need. You can't walk in here. So either this place needs to be bigger and the hallways need to be wider. Or it's just going to be a pain in the butt to navigate in here. Can't find parking can barely walk around... You can barely see the items for sale because they're so so many people and carts everywhere. They need to fix it!",

I got a deal including a shop card for joining so that was nice. One thing, the assortment changes pretty often but you don't really notice it until you go looking for something you were buying regularly and can't find it. I've found many frozen foods here I've enjoyed, and the samples help you try things before buying. I'll definitely renew when it comes time. Only negative is the assortment changes without warning...that is frustrating. But I keep hoping things will come back,  so fingers crossed.",

Definitely recommend getting there early or going later in the evening if you want it to be less crowded. Parking is typical Costco if you get there early, you\u2019ll find a spot. Much easier than going mid day. They have an optical center hearing aid, center pharmacy, cafe and tire center. Staff was very kind and helpful. Seem to have plenty of staff for the opening week. Only hiccup we saw was letting people into the store. They were trying to stagger it and it was quite a mess.",

Enjoyed some tasty food samples indulged in a delicious half pepperoni, half cheese pizza with two refreshing smoothies.\n\nThe food court area felt cramped, with a lot of people moving in different directions. There seemed to be some confusion, with orders being duplicated, and the employees appeared overwhelmed by the volume of orders.\n\nDespite the busyness and being a bit out of the way, it was a worthwhile experience.",

      "text": "In a generalized sense Costco is nice compared to its competitors (I formerly had a BJ\u2019s membership and currently have a Sam\u2019s Club along side Costco). Compared to Sam\u2019s, Costco is a lot cleaner, better organized, and has a lot more premium items available like organic items, a dedicated outside garden section, etc. Sam\u2019s on the other hand has a better dedicated smartphone app where you can order any items that are in-store online, including produce, and schedule a pickup (has dedicated parking spots), it\u2019s useful when it gets pretty busy and crowded or when you need to order a lot of bulk items. The only downside with this Costco specifically, is the parking lot situation, people speed in this busy  parking lot trying to beat traffic only to end up getting stuck in traffic (a mindless move lol) and traffic gets clogged near the 3 way exit since the exit is a shared common intersection with other high traffic stores (seen a few accidents occurred in the past). That and the traffic light that connects this 3 way intersection is connected to the worst part of traffic in Town Center, so the traffic light takes a while to turn green creating this huge mess of a clog. Plan your time to Costco accordingly, a lot of Boomers tend to go early which is when I go to not deal with traffic.",

What is Costco's policy on customers who are screaming at other customers? What about when we tried to part ways, but she kept coming back to yell some more?

Employees have consistently bad attitudes, especially Shirley at the desk who seems to hate the \"no hassle\" return policy. We had to return several food items that we tried, but the quality was terrible. When I told the manager Lexi about the rudeness, she said she investigated MY account history which was \"clean\" -- say what? It seems the product curation/quality is not what it used to be. The fruit is rarely fresh at this store and mold can easily be found -- we've switched to Sam's where it's much better. During COVID they took away the onion topping from the food court, only to bring it back much later in wasteful plastic containers that you have to ask for. They also got rid of the churros and replaced it with.. cookies?!?",

You can't forget their Pharmacy the prices are reasonable to great and the staff is friendly and works with the customers. Now you have to understand that Costco management is rather liberal with some of the products that they buy are International. Which has its good and bad points, mostly good.  You must be careful when buying electrical fixtures because they may not fit a standard American fixture. However their warranty and return policy are very generous towards the customer., we never shy away from buying a product or item knowing that we can return the item if it doesn't fit or works for us.

It's time to let go and come back at another time. Realizing the lost will not hold a light to the insanity. Why don't I go to Costco liquor and grab some wine! WOW, there are only a few people here and no one at the register!! Fantastic. As you wait with two bottles of wine first in line and ready to pay. Where is she, you wonder. Looking around, you hear a voice, be right with you, coming from flat carts full of boxes that are to be stocked on shelves. Be patient, as the line starts to build to three people. Finally, pay the bill, go home, and just stop at Walmart close to home. Phone rings, we're are you hon, on my way. Did you get everything, I got the wine. I'm stopping at Walmart on the way home.

      "text": "Disappointing Experience at the Kendall Costco\n\nAs a single father of twins, I rely heavily on the conveniences and cost savings that come with shopping at bulk stores like Costco. My primary go-to item is baby wipes, as Costco offers a great deal on the brand that has served my family since my daughters were born. Unfortunately, my recent experience at the Kendall Costco on Thursday, April 11, 2024, left me both extremely disappointed and embarrassed.\n\nAfter a long day at work, I rushed to Costco to purchase a box of baby wipes\u2014crucial for my twins\u2014with the last of my budget before the next payday. To my dismay, at the checkout, I was informed that my Costco membership had expired back in December. I understand the policy, but given my tight financial situation, I wasn't prepared to renew my membership on the spot. I explained my predicament to the staff member and asked if I could just buy the wipes and renew my membership later when I had the funds. Unfortunately, the staff was unyielding, even after I requested to speak with a supervisor, insisting that I could not make any purchase without an active membership.\n\nThis policy adherence was disheartening. I was taken aback that a store as large as Costco, which prides itself on customer service and member satisfaction, could not accommodate a small exception during a time of evident need. This incident has motivated me to manage my affairs even more diligently; however, it has also prompted me to reconsider my loyalty to a store that may not support its customers during critical times.\n\nI hope my feedback can prompt Costco to reconsider its policies or how they are enforced, particularly for loyal customers facing temporary hardships. A little flexibility and empathy can go a long way in maintaining customer loyalty and goodwill.",

But, we plan ahead and come here once a month for the essentials, meats, chicken, seafood, cheeses and paper goods. The Kirkland premium paper towels are comparable to the overpriced and overly advertised on TV Bounty the quick picker upper\u202612 rolls for $19.00. Kirkland tissue paper comparable to Charmin\u202630 rolls for $19.00. Their Rotisserie chicken is great more flavorful and better price than Publix for only $4.99. Their bakery is to die for! Awesome cakes, pies, croissants, and large muffins. Yum! \ud83d\ude0d\n\nCostco is great for large families and businesses. Your phone is your best friend at the store, you have to do your due diligence and search if same product can be found for a better price elsewhere. Ask yourself does the membership cost outweigh the inconvenience in parking and long lines at checkout? \ud83e\udd14\n\nWe will not ever shop for only 1 item but we\u2019ve seen people do it. That\u2019s crazy!! \ud83d\ude2f Happy shopping!",

My partner was scanning her items on one lane while I was scanning on another because I wanted to get her a sheet set for her birthday. While checking out my partner tried using a card thats not accepted so the attendant came over and proceeded to give us an attitude and then ask who the member was, I said I was, and then she said that I had to pay, again with a nasty, snarky attitude. This is my FIRST EXPERIENCE CHECKING OUT. Ironically I was going to use my costco card but my partner wanted to pay for groceries this week.\n\nThere\u2019s a way to say things to your customers but apparently this dinosaur that hates her job doesn\u2019t know how to exercise any customer service skills. She was older, wearing a face mask with a pink pattern and had classes with her hair tied back.\n\nAs a business owner in the hospitality industry and if any one of my staff members EVER spoke to any customer this way they would be in the unemployment line within 24 hours.\n\nThis is one of the most unpleasant, unprofessional and incompetent staff members I have ever had the displeasure of interacting with in my life.\n\nFirst real trip to costco, horrible.

      "text": "The experience I had yesterday at the Tire Service Center of Costco in Flagler was extremely disappointing, and I feel compelled to share my story. I took my vehicle there to have a tire inspected, as it showed an evident crack, indicating poor quality (I have attached photos and a video as evidence). Despite assurances from the customer service counter staff that the tire would be replaced under warranty, I was surprised to receive a bill with a charge of $180. I was told that the 40% discount applied to the new tire was considered part of the \"warranty,\" suggesting that these tires are not covered for manufacturing defects. This interpretation of the warranty is misleading and evasive, as it fails to take responsibility for the obvious flaw in the tire I presented. It's worth noting that the tire in question is a Bridgestone Ecopia HL 422, with a 50,000-mile warranty. After discussing my dissatisfaction, I ended up paying $130, but additionally, they installed a tire with a very different tread pattern from the other 3 tires.\nGiven this unsatisfactory experience, I intend to file a formal complaint with Bridgestone regarding the lack of quality in their product. It's crucial to highlight that had I not detected the tire issue in time, I could have faced a potentially fatal risk on the road.",

There is an offer of a $20 Gift Card on the $60 membership on the web! The web site was easy to follow & I received notice of my new membership within a few days. The Gift Card came in 8 days. So, I went to the store on Thursday about 3pm. I went to membership services counter & presented my ID. Alberta was processing my membership application & had a problem with the transaction! She called in Manny to help & I presented my banks payment info to Costco! Everything was then processed & I received my membership card. Everyone was extremely patient, helpful & professional. I then went shopping.  I use Bobby Parrish from You Tube as a helpful guide to shopping at Costco. Most of the items he listed were available! I checked out with Eman at the register. He was very helpful to me in packing my backpack as I am handicapped & use an electric mobility scooter! So, Costco you have another satisfied customer\u2606\u2606\u2606",

Since we are just a family of two, the size of  their ready to cook dinner is perfect for us. We even have leftovers for the next 2 days. The price was $29.99 last year but was up to $40 this year. It's still a good value, and there is minimal work to do. Plus, it's delicious when done. You get the turkey breast, stuffing, gravy, mashed potatoes, green beans, and cranberries.  Just add the wine and dessert.\n\nAs we headed toward the crowded cash registers (the lines started back in the food aisles), an employee came over and took us over to a self serve register but he did the checking out for us and packing! What a blessing! I wish I had gotten his name! Very customer oriented. I added a star just for him.\n\nParking was a zoo as usual at holiday times! It took a while to find a spot out in the left field. Customers were quite impatient. We even got there just a half hour after Costco opened. We were happy that we got everything we needed and made it out of there without any problems.  We will be back next month for Xmas groceries!\n\nOlder review:\n\nGreat sales, we shop for our groceries there,  large selection of meat, produce , and pretty much everything else you can think of at very good prices. The store is kept clean, employees are helpful, lines are quick, and there is ample parking.",

      "text": "I had an appt to have tires put on, I was told it was 1115am, it was actually at 1215. I showed up at 11am told them I would just drop off early and was informed that it wouldnt be  touched until my appt time. I was fine with that, I would just shop in the store.  At 2pm I still had not heard anything about my car and was sitting outside of the tire center just waiting. A young lady that worked in the tire center happened to walk by and I asked what the usual wait time was as my appt was at 1215. She asked the type if car, walked in and got the keys, handed them to me and said it was already done. No one called me and I wouldn't have known unless I asked. She has no customer service skills. Didn't apologize for the lack of communication or anything. Didn't even tell me where my car was so I could get it until I asked. The majority of the staff don't smile, don't greet you in anyway or thank you for coming in. In no way was I pushy or rude during this appt, I wasn't in any rush, just simply was curious of how long the service took. I'm usually a pretty loyal customer to Costco and shop there at least once a week. The grocery shopping may continue but I will never go to the tire center at the Costco in naples. You need to teach some customer service skills to your employees first.",

We still go to the one in Rochester MN where we have our summer home. I've never seen anything like this location in PBG. The lines were all the way down the aisles to the opposite end of the store. On a Monday morning! After waiting half an hour in line and getting up towards the front, they opened a couple of more cashier lines. People started coming into those without waiting in any of the existing lines. Some of the people around me started yelling and even though there was a Costco employee right there, he refused to do anything about it.\n\nIt was so packed, it was hard to navigate around to shop. Worst of all, the main two things I went there for, that I can usually only find at Costco, this location didn't have. There's no sense putting myself through the aggravation of shopping here, if they don't even have what I want (and can easily find at other Costco locations).\n\nI will say the check-out guys were super nice and helpful.",

Despite being a longstanding member of Costco, I was treated poorly by a customer service manager during this process.\n\nUpon presenting my request, the manager cited Costco's policy regarding address verification, noting that our IDs did not display the same address. While I understand the importance of adhering to company policies, I was disheartened by the lack of empathy and willingness to explore alternative solutions.\n\nAs newlyweds in the process of updating our personal documentation, we encountered a hurdle that required understanding and flexibility from your staff. Unfortunately, the manager in question did not offer any assistance beyond citing policy, leaving us feeling dismissed and undervalued as customers.\n\nI must commend the swift and efficient intervention of the supervisor we eventually sought assistance from. She demonstrated a keen understanding of our situation and promptly resolved the issue by accepting our joint bank account statement as proof of residence.\n\nThis incident highlights a significant gap in customer service on the part of the manager involved. While I appreciate the resolution provided by the supervisor, it is imperative that instances of poor service be addressed to ensure a positive shopping experience for all Costco members.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter\n\nSincerely,\nKathryn",

We customers DO NOTICE SUSTAINABILITY!!\n\nToday there were quite a few nice sales & for my kids, I picked up two bags of frozen, chocolate covered yogurt drops for a great price!\n\nGarden items once again looked AMAZING!  They had a copper patio fountain for $199. that was gorgeous; tall glazed & short basic planters; hoses; roses & so much more.  Worth a trip just to pick up garden basics for very affordable prices!\n\n\u2026I\u2019m a stickler for baking only with real butter & generally pick up a package of Irish butter most trips (Kerry Gold is the absolute best!)  Great shopping today & staff was very kind \ud83d\ude0d!\n\nPrior Review: Holiday baking & decorating are easier (& less expensive) shopping Costco.  I buy their 25 lb. bag of flour; Lg. Organic Sugar; Irish Butter; Lg. Tub Sr. Cream; bulk spices; cream cheese; eggs by the box; chocolate chips; fruits & all my nuts here.  Wed. this week I was behind on Thanksgiving baking (family came in) so I stayed up all night & did 3 day\u2019s worth utilizing my Costco pantry items.  I delivered it up Thanksgiving & everything was a hit!  Especially happily surprised to find the Pillsbury Pie Crust in freezer section this season as it saved time.  I\u2019m definitely satisfied with this year\u2019s selections & picked up the two adorable holiday lanterns here, too.  (Adding to my holiday display w the two 5 ft. Nutcrackers I purchased here two years ago.) \ud83c\udf84\ud83e\udd70\ud83c\udf84",

When I got home, I opened the box and tried to turn on the watch, but there was no power button, and the charger didn't connect to the watch. At 10 am on April 22, 2024, I went to Apple, and the support team told me it was fake. I returned to Costco at 12 pm. The manager, Fritz, checked the device and confirmed that I made the purchase on the 21st through the cameras and that it was delivered to me by one of their salespeople. However, unfortunately, Fritz said he couldn't refund my money or give me the correct product. I returned in less than 24 hours, and Costco did nothing about it. This is outrageous; it has nothing to do with their internal problems. Furthermore, the manager told me they purchase from Apple, but when I went to the store, they said Costco doesn't have a selling partnership and doesn't buy directly from Apple. Be careful when buying products from this place. Lack of respect for the consumer.",

I am a law abiding citizen and to be treated this way by the store was horrific. I would suggest to everyone to not go to this store. There are other big box stores near by that I\u2019m sure would love to have your support. I am truly saddened by how I was treated.

I understand that policies are set in place, however, the way it was handled when I tried to use my Costco membership card and then my partners credit card was insane.\n\nThe cashier made this huge deal about it and tried to over explain the entire policy. She even offered for my partner (who lives in the same household) to apply for a membership. How in the world does that make any sense at all?? Sure, all I need to do is add him as the second card holder, but the way this entire thing was handled was just unprofessional. I politely asked if she could please call a manager over since this is the first time shopping there since this policy update. Luckily, the manager approved us to go ahead and go through and walked away.\n\nThen, the cashier scanned all of our items (while looking at my partners card knowing they don\u2019t take American Express and once everything was rang through the cashier said in a snarky tone \u201cwe don\u2019t take American Express here.\u201d\n\nI had forgotten that they didn\u2019t take the card and unfortunately we didn\u2019t have another option for payment (and it was for his work) to complete the transaction.\n\nShe then proceeded to ask what she should do and I said \u201cI guess you need to cancel the transaction and have someone put these items back, huh?\u201d\n\nTo make it even better the ladies at the food court are mostly rude and yelling behind the counter about how they are out of things and they don\u2019t care and they just have so much to do. I understand short staffing and being stressed out but as a customer it\u2019s not that great to listen to that.\n\nOnce my membership expires in July of this year I do not plan on renewing because Costco (as a company) seems to not care about their customer service for their shoppers and is making it more difficult to just go into their stores and shop. I\u2019ve already signed up for a Sam\u2019s Club membership and it\u2019s 100 times better already.\n\nBe better Costco!!!",

Free nitrogen gas always available. They also sell liquor separately from the other merchandise.\n\nThey rotate their sales fairly frequently, so it's always a pleasant surprise when something good is on sale. The staff are also friendlier than some other Costco's that I have visited. Keep in mind that Costco staff do not bring in carts if it's raining though.",

The store is very organized and there are lots of great benefits to having a Costco membership! The credit card, the gasoline, the automotive section, and lots more!\n\nThe only complaints I would have is that the customer service is mediocre, there's always a long line to return and to speak with customer service at the desk. It would be nice if they had another person that could jump on this and help the lines not take so long in this section. I also have a Sam's club membership and they have an app where you can check out from your phone which is so useful so you don't have to sit in super long lines. Costco can be ridiculously busy And it would be amazing if I could check out on my phone like I can at Sam's club. And on top of that, Sam's club does seem to have better deals more often than Costco. Food is definitely comparably cheaper most of the time depending on what you're getting. So they could be a little bit more competitive in that sense. Other than that, I definitely like Costco and I will continue to come here.",

      "text": "I headed to Costco because I had been thinking about joining for several years. Saturday December 17, I thought, was the day I would finally become a member. For some reason, I thought membership cost $100. The Goldstar membership is only $60. It's the executive membership that's $120.\n\nOne of the things I looked for when I entered the store was the price of fuel. I couldn't find a sign with the prices. However, an employee at the membership counter told me that their fuel price is only $2.41 per gallon. At Hy-Vee, it's $3.09! Wow! I found out you don't have to be a member to look around the store or to go to the food court. That's nice! I took the opportunity to look around.\n\nI found several things I put on my mental list of things I might buy in the future. I also enjoyed their food sample stations. They have several of them spread around the store. I saw a wide range of products from TVs, Bose headphones, chairs, a grocery store section, and plenty of snacks. Oh, I could get into trouble with all the snacks they sell here. I was disappointed when I found out their optical center doesn't work with the company I have for vision insurance which is Eye Med. It is worth mentioning that the reason I wanted a Costco membership instead of a Sam's membership is Costco has a reputation for paying and treating their employee much better.\n\nAfter taking a good look around, I walked back to the membership counter to buy a membership. The woman who helped me gave me a lot of helpful information, and I could tell she really wanted me to sign up for the Executive membership. She also encouraged me to sign up for a Costco Visa credit card. I said I was interested in the Goldstar membership. As she was taking my information, I asked if Costco takes Apple Pay. She said, \"Only if it's linked to a Visa credit or debit card.\" And that's why I am giving Costco 4 stars instead of 5. I have never heard of a store that won't take Mastercard. That's all I have, and I refuse to carry cash. I ended up walking out of the store with nothing because of that policy. Maybe one day I will have a Visa card. Until then, I can't shop at Costco. Their loss.",

She needed to see my Costco card and check my identity for some reason and I didn't have a third hand to get out my card. So she holds some of my stuff because there's no where to set anything down (NOT THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO ANYWAY UNLESS I'M SCANNING TO CHECKOUT!) and checks my card and hands it back to me. I put my card away, wait a moment to step up to scan, and of course I have to get my card out again. There's no where to put my stuff and I can't set it anywhere near the self checkout machine. So I set it on the floor, get out my card again.\n\nI'm in this store a couple times a week and I've never seen them really check my card in a regular checkout aisle. Is self checkout some awesome place and I'm just missing out? Don't you want people to want to use self checkout? You don't act like it.\n\nYou need to find a better way to accommodate people without carts which you should be doing already at self checkout. Have an empty cart sitting around or something. I can't imagine one person has looked at your setup and asked how grossly unpleasant your self checkout must be for customers.",

The only way to put in an order is to come into the store and fill out a form at least 24 hours in advance. You can't do it online, you can't do it over the phone, hell, you can't even fax it in. It has to be in person. I'm there enough that this usually isn't a problem, but I hate having to make an extra trip ocassionally because of an ancient process.

They told me I couldn\u2019t buy anything because my name wasn\u2019t on the card. It was my husband\u2019s card. I was buying food for our family. I was told that they were cracking down on delinquent using the wrong card. Applied that I  was one. I tried to explain and they said well we will see if you are actually on the account. I just said I\u2019m already late meeting my kids from school.\nI dragged my 4 year old out of the store bawling that we forgot all our stuff. We left all our stuff mom. You will be embarrassed in front of everyone if your name is not on the card. Never going back. And I know it doesn\u2019t matter and they don\u2019t care. Which is what makes me the most upset.",

We like to be able to put items in the boxes to accommodate for that.  Usually they'll scan the heavy and or big items for us at self check out.  However on this particular occasion we got denied use of the self check out lanes by an employee who said we had to many items.  We had 14 items total.  We had two milks and 1 Capri sun pack.  That would have been considered heavy. We have done self check out numerous times with wayyy way more items before and no problem.  We triggered the over weight warning once on a separate occasion.  So we are aware of it.  Again usually employees offer to scan heavy and big items so I'm very  confused as to why we were denied use.   So we went to a person to check us out and they didn't even offer us a box. Which again is the main reason we do self check out.  So we can use the boxes to help us unload and pack it up several flights of stairs.  I find today's experience to be rude and unprofessional.",

The ready-to-eat food is notably fresh and served on the same day, while fruits, vegetables, and produce are consistently fresh and of high quality. I really appreciate the attention to detail they demonstrate in arranging their products. My only minor concern would be the parking area, which can sometimes be a bit challenging to find an available spot. Overall, shopping at this Costco is an experience I always look forward to.",

Were glad we ordered whole pizza in a box otherwise i will definitely say something if she put the dirty receipt on top of our food . Managers should do something about this. This could be food contamination issue",

She confirmed I used to be a member, asked where the member was I told her at work I was on the phone with my mom n my mom asked her if I could use the card she said \u201csorry I can\u2019t let you purchase anything\u201d in a smug tone. I believe she racially profiled me because everyone else in line is white, I will NOT be stepping foot in ANY Costco in the future it\u2019s too busy and the people are rude anyway.",

When we arrived to pick up an order, they told us it would be 20 minutes. We said we had a call ahead order with a pickup time. They argued and said it was for a pickup 15 minutes later. This is absolutely not true. We have a party planned and we're picking up pizzas for it. We scheduled the order 30 minutes in advance. We would not schedule the order to be ready only 10 minutes before the party starts. We need to be back home at that time ready to greet guests. Telling them is useless. They make it seem like it's your fault for arriving early to get your order, and deny any input of your order time from you. Other reviews mention they only start your order when you arrive, and I'd have to agree. That defeats the point of making an order ahead, doesn't it? You'd order early to have it ready when you arrive.",

I buy 93% lean hamburger meat from Walmart and that is no where to be found here. That's disappointing. Costco is missing the one probiotic that I need. It needs to be above 50 billion. I agree to using boxes but they need handles to hold the box. On all of them. I need to be able to grip the box. I hate that you upsell and encourage members to auto pay for their next year membership. I don't even like the membership to be honest.  For single people bulk buying isn't always necessary.

      "text": "Visited 05/09/24. It was actually the best Costco experience I've ever had, until the end. It was empty, no customers in sight, I grabbed what I needed and went to check out. The gentleman at self checkout was super helpful and kind, he even offered to scan my groceries for me since he had a handy scanner gun. Everything was wonderful until I hit the door. They did as they always have, and checked my goods in comparison to my receipt. All was good to go until she moves a couple boxes and sees an $8 pack of batteries. I immediately apologize, offer to go back, and explain what had happened. Rather than ask the gentleman standing 50 ft away, doing nothing, she calls down a manager, who tells me they will not be asking him. After 20 minutes of hemming and hawing, someone FINALLY takes the miniscule amount of time and effort, and lo and behold, I told the truth. If Costco was not a unique service, I would have canceled my membership immediately over the sheer laziness and lack of respect shown by management.",

They keep the store clean and provide friendly service. The downside is looking for parking since it's always so busy and waiting in line. It can get seriously packed during peak hours. My best recommendation is to show up right before it opens! They'll usually let you in 5 mins before or so, 15 minutes after it opens, it already started filling in with the crowd.",

Each time we visit, she has the same bubbling personality and beautiful spirit!  I made it a point the last time to say some thing to the store's manager and was extremely disappointed with his nonchalant and a bit dismissve attitude at my praise for a member of his team.  The absolute most important asset that any company has is its employees.  I am so glad that Ms. Tammi is on the forefront as she makes every customer feel warm and welcome.  My sincere Thank You and appreciation for her!  Go by and see Ms. Tammi!!",

Friday at  1pm and  they had 4 packages left.  It looked fat and brown , so I asked the young wrapper if he could get me another package.  He told me to wait a minute.  Some guy came to the window with a major attitude and said he couldn't sell it until the test was done.  I get that, but stop with the attitude, you should have more than 4 packages of hamburger at 1 o'clock on a Friday.  I wasn't going to waste anymore of my time, so I took one from the counter.  Well, when we got home and cooked some of it, there was no way it was 12% or less fat.  Maybe Mr.Attitude should see what percentage of fat is actually in those tests.  I think we'll be shopping at a Costco a little bit farther from home.  It won't be a waste of time if I have to wait for hamburger now would it.",

The store's layout was organized and easy to navigate, making my shopping experience efficient and enjoyable.\n\nOne thing that stood out to me was the incredible variety of products available. From fresh produce to electronics to household essentials, Costco had everything I needed and more. The quality of the products was top-notch, and the prices were incredibly competitive, saving me money without compromising on quality.\n\nThe staff at Costco were friendly, knowledgeable, and always ready to assist. Whether it was helping me find a specific item or answering questions about membership benefits, they went above and beyond to ensure customer satisfaction.\n\nAnother aspect I appreciated was the convenience of Costco's services, such as their pharmacy and optical center. It made it easy for me to take care of multiple errands in one trip, saving me time and hassle.\n\nOverall, my experience at Costco was nothing short of fantastic. I highly recommend this store to anyone looking for a wide selection of high-quality products, great prices, and excellent customer service.",

Costco truly has everything one could desire, from fresh produce and fruits to bakery items, dairy products, meats, and a remarkable selection of wines. Personally, these are my regular purchases at Costco. Their food court, especially their classic hot dog combo with a regular-sized fountain drink for $1.50, has been a beloved favorite since the 1980s, reflecting their customer-oriented business philosophy.",

This attitude issue was used to be very rare, then quite often, and now very common. It started from the Customer Service, then cashier, and now everywhere... Yesterday, when I was checking out, the employee who was supposed to help with unloading/loading chose to ignore me but just stood there doing nothing. Of course I can do this by myself, but how about people need this help?  When I put most of the items on the counter, he suddenly told me \"stop, leave them in the cart\" very seriously, sounds like I did something wrong. Then he kept talking with the cashier while throwing all the scanned items back into cart, including bananas. Of course, the only thing he didn't throw back to the cart were eggs...  When I came to the lady at the gate who checks my receipt, I said \"Hello\" and smiled to her, well, she didn't answer but sighed... I remember it used to be \"how are you\", \"thank you\", or \"have a great day\" with smiling faces? what is going on at this Costco?",

This store is different from the retail Costco stores in that it caters to small businesses. This means they stock many items small businesses and restaurants use such as to go containers, beverages, paper products, a wide selection of meats.  Most items are sold in bulk so you may have to split them up and store them.  If you are willing to do this, there are huge savings to be found.

On 03/30/24, a supervisor (I believe her name was Michelle with the brownish-red curly hair) gave my family and I the most distasteful attitude during our visit once we made it to the check out area. We made it to the very front of the line and were asked to then move to the back of another line that wasn\u2019t self check-out because we had full carts. I had large items at the bottom of my cart that she did not want to scan with the portable scanning gun. We had already waited in the checkout line for so long, so I immediately declined as we were already at the next available register and continued with our self check out. As we are checking out we were rudely talked about and shamed within earshot of us and all the other customers doing their self-checkouts. If I was not going to be allowed to check out in self check out an employee should have been making that obvious way before I made it to being the next person in line for a register. More importantly, the situation could have been handled more professionally and I could have been asked to move lines in a much more polite manner, but instead we were treated like trash and spoken to disrespectfully and I just wasn\u2019t going to take that treatment. Together, we spent nearly $500 here for our family\u2019s Easter weekend celebration, and I\u2019m regretting the fact that I still gave the company my business that day when I should have just left the cart full of items and walked away. I hate to discontinue my membership with the company but my family and I will not tolerate such disrespectful behavior again.  Please do better Costco, and teach your employees to be better human beings.",

      "text": "What can I say.. it's Costco ... I love everything about it. This location is my personal favorite. Even when it's packed, honestly it's never that difficult to find parking, and the parking lot is mostly easy to maneuver. When the lines are long at checkout, they move quickly and efficiently, and if you go through self checkout it takes mere minutes to get through. I believe it says a lot about a company when the employees stay on, and I've seen the same people working here for years and years.  Customer service is great, everyone is helpful, Costco is life \ud83d\ude4c",

      "text": "My family just got treated like criminals at your establishment. We checked out with your staff spending close to $700 which is typical for us since we have been executive members since 2018. This was our first experience at Woodstock Costco. We are in line to leave the store and the lady who looks over receipts is glancing at everyone's shopping cart signing off... until it was our turn. Keep in mind we have a lot of stuff. She goes through each item individually and found 1 out of 4 egg cartons was not ringed up properly. The approach was pretty unprofessional. Its not my fault that your team missed an item. It's literally 1% of what I purchased. There is a massive line behind me and people watching as My family including our newborn son is being held because of a carton of eggs. Anyways she forced me to leave my family and says I have to go to the tire center to pay for the eggs. I'm definitely not happy at this point. The guy at the tire center could tell as I'm standing in line. He was the only person in this scenario who showed any empathy. Turns out the lady sent me to the wrong location. I was suppose to go to the other side of the aisle where a lady was standing by some tires. Now this small petite blond woman seemed to continue the vibe of the lady at the door and treated me like I was trash. She said \"I was standing here the whole time\" and continued to give me \"stink eye\" the entire time. Finally were done here she begrudgingly gives me my receipt and I go on my way back to Lady #1 who of course once again checks my receipt to make sure I didn't steal the eggs. My $700 purchase made me back 2% and my credit card I used made me an additional 1.5%. I made $24.50 on this transaction with Costco. Why would I steal a $7 egg carton....? My family has probably spent close to $50k since 2018 at your store. Now the wife and I embarrassed by the way we were treated will probably never come back to your establishment.",

First thing I noticed was how quiet it was. There were no forklifts in the background. There were no demo ladies handing out samples. No one was trying to sell upgrades or whatever other items get pushed at regular Costco\u2019s. I assume it\u2019s because the business center crowd are shopping for what they need on a weekly(daily?) basis and are already taking advantage of the executive savings. It wasn\u2019t as busy as a normal Costco, which made moving through the aisles a breeze. The employees seemed happy and were very helpful. One cashier saw I was buying pull-ups and offered some great advice for potty training my three year old son! Absolutely loved my experience!",

Virtually every time I've come in there's a guy walking around staring at naked pics of clearly not his wife who's walking in front of him, another guy opening a  product per isle and taking a bite to put it back, or my favorite the amount of people who park in the middle of an isle on speakerphone. As for the actual store they wouldn't let me use my husband's card because I couldn't find mine and I didn't find out till I'd finished an hour of shopping. Sticky floors and cashiers that are the spectrum of rudeness to only nods once to flirts with your husband then scoffs in your face. I literally use this as a last resort.",

      "text": "As a veteran, I applied and got hired. Throughout the first week, they emphasized on speed but kept pulling me from station to station to station causing me to not really learn the pace of the store at all. \"Work with this person and follow what they do, ask what they need help with\" further increasing me no opportunity to really pace myself. Being a shadow of another person makes you work slower obviously, you're learning and being taught. The one moment i did get a task to myself it was to swap 3 products from 2 different isles. I managed to complete it in 15 minutes, they then told me it should have taken 10 minutes and the speed is too slow.\nThe speed they were looking for was to throw boxes of products everywhere and destroy the boxes while shoving products behind others or even under or above to make it look \"Full\". Upon inspecting the store, there is many broken boards, items, products and produce everywhere shoved in places out of view. The goal they really gave off was quantity over quality. They expected the speed of someone who has been working there for a long while from a person there for 12 days,  it wasn't  the \"Costco Standard\". I was pulled in front of everyone by Jack and announced for me to go to the office half way through the shift. Not a very professional way of letting off a person.\n\nThey over order and shove the fridge/freezer with the items. They take out every pallet they have in the store blocking walking space and have frozen and refrigerated items sitting out from open 4am untill the last 30 minutes from opening which is around 10am. Items that can't be filled are still brought out  and sit untill opening to further make walking difficult.",

The roasted chicken for $5 is a great price and so is the food, court it can't be beat. Some of the items we purchase: All of our seafood, all meat as it's all choice. We buy it in bulk and separate it and freeze it in smaller containers. We buy our cheese, frozen fruit, yogurt, seltzer water, soap, olive oil, tuna, walnuts, almonds, just to name a few things. They sometimes have great specials on shoes and clothes. The only reason I am giving them four stars in summerlin is they need to build another one in the area. It's way too crowded every time I come here!!! No parking and long lines. Costco build another Costco! The pictures I'm attaching were just when it opened as I was one of the first in line.",

Normally Costco is well organized, employees keep it moving, cashier's are quick and efficient, well stocked. Last few visits, employees standing around chit chatting, cashier's moving slower than I've ever seen, lines taking much longer and reaching further back in the store. My trips take twice as long now easily. The final straw was being told our pizza would take 15 minutes and after 20 minutes of waiting, I checked in and was told they forgot about it. Just really put a damper on an already sour trip at what is normally a fantastic store (this location and all others I've been to). Maybe it's just been a off few months? Not sure but starting to feel frustrated to say the least.",

      "text": "Friendly, efficient check-out counter staff.  They move customers in and out of their facility in record-breaking, timely manner.  And, all the customer needs to do is have their check-list of items handy, move to those known product pick-up spots, and zoom along from one location to another.  And, before you know it, you're out the door and on your way.   And, even on those very busy days, with a little bit of patience (and luck), that illusive, coveted, prime parking spot (and all you need is one slot) usually becomes available.  At least, that's my experience.\n\nMy Time-Tested Costco Wholesale \"Parking Lot Sweep\"\nMy strategy for securing fast parking.  Sorry (I played high school football).  It's football season.  I couldn't resist. So, ready?  Here goes.  Is your helmet secure, shoulders pads firmly tied down and mouth piece in place?  Ready, set, hut ... for the Costco Wholesale \"Parking Lot Sweep.\" Now, first you've stayed away from Dillingham Boulevard.  It's a mess out there with rail construction.  Forget the Mauka (mountain-side) approach.  Instead, charge Costco from Nimitiz Highway, right?  Your BEST BET (I believe) is the Makai (ocean side) approach. Thank you for the wait.\n\nMy \"Costco Wholesale Parking Lot Sweep\" Images Are Now Posted.  So, for me at least, my fully tested \"true and tried\" \"Costco Parking Lot Sweep\" always yields my strategic outcome.  To date, I have always found my one needed spot on every parking foray.  So similarly, to YOU my reader, may \"the sweep\" be with you!!!\n\nNOW, I also have my carefully developed priorities list of \"healthy foods and drinks\".  For me at least, they have those \"body nourishing special foods and accompanying drinks.\" IF you look carefully for them.  The fruits (on my list) include avacados, bananas, blueberries (fresh and frozen), raisins (and grapes), kiwifruits (chock full of vitamin C).  (NOTE: PLEASE SEE my POB 1 post for more details).  They have eggs, milk (2%), juices (orange and POG), whole wheat breads and green vegetables (like spinach, broccoli, and potatos).  They have peanut butter and jams (strawberry is my favorite).  And, their's is a wide selection of red wines.  Mind you, this is my very personal list (after consultation with my doctors and nurses as well as internet and YouTube sources) of what I personally believe are the healthiest foods.\n\nOh yes.  And, there is Kirkland 100 % Columbian dark roast coffee.  I love the rich flavor.  It remains my favorite.\n\nAnd, I'm still getting acquainted with the variety of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (in dark glass bottles with .5 % maximum acidity) from the Mediterranean (Kirkland's Toscano P.G.I from Tuscany, Italy) and .3% maximum acidity Kirkland's California Cuyana Valley, Fall 2022 harvest.  A CAUTIONARY NOTE:  There are fraudulent, or diluted olive oils on the market.  (Here, I'm still on my learning curve).  I need patience.  Please see my latest posts on these developments.\n\nSO, PLEASE CAREFULLY read the labels (harvest in fall, harvest location (one locale?), production methods, expiration dates, maximimum acidity, .5%, .3% etc, if available).  They should be on your olive oil containers, which should be bottled in dark glass.  These are the current standards that I know.\n\nTo your health!!!",

If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll wait forever. It\u2019s just really a weird process, considering before you could order at the kiosk, and then they would call your number when it\u2019s ready. Judging by all the signage, that\u2019s how they how they want to do it now, but it\u2019s just weird. If I order at the kiosk at McDonald\u2019s, it\u2019s in their system, the order will get pulled whether I\u2019m there or not, since I already paid for it. You still get your order in a timely fashion, it\u2019s just a weird extra step you have to do, for seemingly no other purpose, other then their ticket machine is temporarily down, which it\u2019s not. They chose to run it like this. Very weird, and other customers were just as confused as I was at first. Kinda just confused at how this would make everything \u201ceasier\u201d. Other then that staff is nice and still a good experience, system is just weird now.",

      "text": "I Love Coming to Costco!\n\nI have been a member of Costco for years, and this is where we do 80%of our grocery shopping. This particular Costco in Kailua Kona is frequently visited by locals and tourists. Because this is the only costco on the island, people from all over come here one a week or bi weekly to get their groceries. Keep in mind that the weekends you may experience heavy traffic! Just be prepared.\n\nFirst and foremost, the staff at this location are incredibly friendly and helpful. They truly embody the \"Aloha Spirit,\" making our shopping experience all the more enjoyable. Whenever we need assistance or have questions about any products, they are always available and eager to help.\n\nOne of the things we love most about this Costco is the great selection of local favorites. They consistently have a fantastic assortment of new, unique, and innovative products available, and we never fail to discover something new each time we visit. Additionally, their inventory is always well-stocked with beach gear, making it our go-to spot for all our beach essentials! This is where we shop for nuts to give to our family as gifts. They also carry local restaurant gift cards to Umekes or macaroni and grill at a discounted price.\n\nAt this Costco, you can find everything you need at unbeatable prices, and that includes gas! With a gas station conveniently located nearby, it's easy to fill up our vehicle while also stocking up on groceries, housewares, and beyond.\n\nWe also appreciate the concession area in the front of the store, perfect for grabbing a quick and delicious snack after a day full of shopping. It's another perk that makes this location stand out from the rest.\n\nI cannot recommend the Costco in Kailua Kona enough. Its friendly staff, variety of products, beach gear selection, and top-notch customer experience make it an outstanding place to shop, and we always look forward to our next visit. Give it a try, and I'm confident you'll love it just as much as we do!",

      "text": "Love that there is a Costco on all of the main Hawaiian islands.  Thankfully this one is located in Kona and not in Hilo (in Hilo just go to Cost.U.Less).  You can find local Hawaiian gifts only available in the Hawaiian Costcos ie 100% Hawaiian coffee, 100% Hawaiian Peaberry Coffee, chocolate covered macadamia nuts, 100% Kona coffee, beach equipment, amazing flower bouquets, etc at great prices.\n\nBut remember to look at quantity limits (per day) when buying if getting gifts so you're not trying to buy over limit in a single day.\n\nThe macadamia nuts, chocolate covered or otherwise, sold here are HUGE, super tasty!\n\nThey have all sorts of dried seafood snacks, fresh seaweed salad, kimchi imported from Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, etc.\n\nDON'T BUY CUT FRUIT (papayas, pineapples, mangos) at Costco.  The local Farmer's Market or KTA Superstores carry local Hawaiian grown produce which is MUCH TASTIER and SWEETER than Costco's.\n\nDefinitely buy the 24 slice La Tour Bakery raisin bread, it is so good on its own, buttered, jammed, for sandwiches or French toast.  It's only sold in the Hawaiian islands. How good is it?  An entire floor to top section was full of this bread 3 days ago, today there was 4 left.  We bought 2 to take back to the mainland!\n\nCheckout lines are super long as EVERYONE including tourists shop here.  The Costco food court wait is just unbelievable, like an hour wait.\n\nA MUST shopping destination for those staying a week+.",

If you have the storage space and enough people in your family to warrant bulk shopping then warehouse buying is usually the way to go.  Most of the time Costco's every day prices are cheaper than even the sale prices at the markets and department stores.\n\nYou can also purchase gasoline there at a huge savings over a gas station and they also have a tire department if you need new tires for your car.\n\nCostco also offers a Citibank rewards VISA credit card.  You get between 1% to 4% rewards benefits that are paid to you in a check when your cycle ends.  Depending on what you use the charge card for you can end up with a nice rewards check once a year that can be cashed or used to pay for your purchase at the register.  Whatever leftover bonus money you don't spend is given back to you in cash.  So if your bonus check is $400 and your bill is only $200 you get $200 in cash back.  It's a great deal and my favorite part of having the rewards card.  You can use the card anywhere VISA is accepted.\n\nCostco has a pharmacy where you can pick up your medications and you will find a little bit of just about everything in the stores.  Most of it is food products but you can also get household items, appliances, automotive, hardware, electrical items, furniture, electronics, paper goods, cleaning items, over the counter pharmacy items, fresh flowers and orchids, freshly baked pies, cookies, breads, and pastries, cigarettes, liquor, ready made cooked foods such as a roasted chicken  for around $5 and so much more.",

However, the experiences at service desk and cashiers in the last few months have made me think twice before going here.\n\nTwo different persons at return desk on different days have told us to look up order number for items bought in warehouse instead of looking up in their system. One of them even claimed that looking it up on their system wastes time. My friend, YOU are being paid for the time. The customers' time is being wasted with your ineptitude. -1 star\n\nI understand the corporate push for Costco app since it generates data but please don't misguide customers about policy changes like 'no returns without app or print receipt'. If that is your policy, clearly display it at the door and at the cashier and I'll think thrice before picking an item from your shelf. -1 star\n\nThe cashiers are being measured for the number of customers they push through. As a result, they have lost the ability to be kind. They are visibly stressed when one customer with a large number of items approaches instead of being happy about higher spending per household. If you really want to measure efficiency, measure the number of items cashiers scan during a shift. There is no excuse for being inconsiderate or accusing customers of wasting their precious time by 'blocking the line'. Do you want the customers in your warehouse or not? -1 stars",

      "text": "I recently had a disappointing encounter at Costco involving an employee named Celsira, and I feel compelled to share my experience. My family and I visited the store to prepare for an upcoming party, and unfortunately, this incident has left me reconsidering future visits.\n\nWhile exiting the store, Celsira questioned if I had paid for the jacket I was wearing without thoroughly checking my receipt. Despite clarifying that it was my personal jacket from American Eagle, she insisted on reviewing security footage, creating an uncomfortable and unnecessary situation.\n\nSeeking resolution, I requested to speak with a manager. Unfortunately, no one responded for nearly 30 minutes, prompting me to locate a manager inside the store. To my dismay, the manager and Celsira conversed in Spanish, despite my request for English, adding to my frustration.\n\nThis experience, coupled with the lack of immediate resolution, has significantly impacted my perception of Costco. As a loyal customer, feeling unjustly accused and witnessing a lack of effective communication is disheartening.\n\nI hope this review prompts a thorough examination of the customer service practices at this location to ensure a more positive experience for future patrons.",

His demeanor Indicated he was just unhappy to be there working at all, then he looks at me and say next time remove the shipping label from the boxes before you return them. I honestly felt chocked, as it seemed he was only looking for a reason to be nasty. The return was brand new unopened, I didn\u2019t have to explain to him at all why I returned them. Yet, he found a reason to complain that I never heard of. Never in my life have I heard an employee ask me to remove a shipping label from a product I bought.

      "text": "I used to love Costco for its deals and customer service. After today, my mind is changed.  I drove 30 minutes to Costco to purchase a new battery for my car. I brought a 10mm socket and wrench to remove the battery terminals when I arrived to trade in for the core charge.  Turns out, I didn't realize that there is another 3/4\" bolt holding the bottom of the battery in it's place.  So I can't remove the battery to turn in for the core charge.   I asked the sales associate at the battery and tire center if they had any loaner tools that I could borrow for a few minutes. He said that it's against Costco's policy to lend a simple adjustable wrench or some other tool for their customers to remove their batteries from their cars.\n\nHe also said that \"people steal them, and that's why they don't lend them out.\"  First off, customers are being charged a $15 core charge, so there is an incentive for the customer to return the tool and old battery to get their $15 back! If you're still stuck on providing poor customer service at the battery center for customers purchasing batteries, then sell tools there! I went back into the store looking for a toolset, they didn't have any at the time.\n\nThis is so frustrating! Now, I have to make another 1hr r/t drive to get the $15 core charge back.\n\nEither lend tools, sell tools, or don't sell batteries at all!  Poor customer experience.",

It is one of many American wholesale clubs where customers can purchase bulk quantities of merchandise at discounted prices, but only if they are club members who pay an annual fee. Costco offers various products, including electronics, computers, furniture, appliances, jewelry, fresh and cooked food, meats, fruits, vegetables, clothes, and much more. This store also features a Tire Center for tire and car technical needs, complimentary tire air-pressure machines, a gas station exclusively for members, an in-house food court, a hearing aid store, a pharmacy, a vision center, and a bakery. Costco also sends out a membership magazine, the Costco Connection, periodically. Although some products require bulk purchases for discounts, I appreciate Costco's reasonable prices and quality products. Additionally, ample parking is available in the lot, but the store can get busy, especially on weekends.",

      "text": "Costco sells plants and small trees during Spring time but has no arrangements to facilitate customer buying in bulk to load to their cars. I bought 10 trees today, had to go all the way upfront to request the manager of if I can pull my car to the back door so that I can load easily. The manager obliged my request but informed me, it\u2019s a one time deal. Is Costco so well known for customer service sliding downwards? How do they expect a customer to cart bulky items through the crowd using the regular line via the cashier. It is highly unreasonable, some of these trees are 6 to 9 ft tall with huge plastic pots. This is just plain lack of empathy towards customers buying bulky items. Hope you can improve Costco! Or maybe you don\u2019t care anymore. Because this option was available in past years. You pay, show the receipt and pickup bulky items at the back. Saving you the headache to navigate through families with kids shopping at the store.",

I somewhat tolerated their downgraded churros compared to their delicious traditional ones. Today, as of 1/20/24, I found out their churros were discontinued. Wahhh. I then see that the churros were replaced by these expensive $2.74 (including VA tax already). The problem is that the cookie is hard on the sides but soft on the inside. The taste was even worse. Poorly made.  Rather than buying this new addition to their menu, buy the chocolate cookies from the Costco bakery section. So long, Costco churros. So long.",

      "text": "This is a VERY difficult review (and the longest one I've ever written) because I am a Costco person #kirklandgang (not a real gang obviously, just a group of people who love Costco lol).\n\nEither way, I'm gonna give Costco a 2 out of 5 star in this Google review because I'm tired of the experience I've been having at the Costco food court. Enough is enough!\n\nCostco pizza is a 9 out of 10! I would give it a 10 if they brought back the veggie pizza and Supreme pizza options. (hint hint)\n\nBut the issue and situation with the food courts at the two Costcos I frequent is a mess (Alexandria Rt 1 and Woodbridge Potomac Mills). The wait time for the whole pizzas can be over 40 minutes which truthfully that isn't the issue. I wait without much complaint as long as 1.5 hours for 2 pizzas at least once a month. My issue is the gaggle of people,  poor organization/flow of service and the minimal customer service that I continue to get. It's obviously not just me because most of the customers are feeling the same frustration when I'm there.\n\nToday,  I experienced the worst customer service I've ever experienced at Costco. I won't mention his name although I seriously debated it bc he was rude to me and his co-worker that was trying to help me. And it's not the 1st time I've experienced it or seen it.\n\nHe should not be customer facing with that type of disposition. I thank the manager Jasmine and the supervisor and the employee that was actually trying to help me get the drinks for my kids and I while I waited for the pizza. With a 30 minute wait time getting your other items IF you want them should not be a problem-and normally isn't with anyone else but him. He rudely told his coworker that I could wait eventhough they were calling orders past my number. He said it 3 times while I was standing in front of him as if I wasn't there and as if she wasn't allowed to help me as if he was in charge. I don't know who he thought he was dealing with. I kept my cool but addressed his rude customer service and asked why I couldn't get my items while I wait for my pizza and asked for a manager. After talking to the supervisor who was helpful but I asked for a manager because I needed to ensure I was heard.\n\nNow please keep in mind I rarely write negative reviews bc I recognize that everyone's experiences are different and I like to give places chances to do better but poor customer service is a huge problem that is so easy to avoid and easy to correct with a little bit of courtesy and respect. Please note I've worked at Taco Bell, McDonald's, TGI Fridays, Golden Corral and other restaurants and customer service jobs in highschool and college and even after I graduated. I am a process improvement and project manager and if anyone asked me I'd love to give some simple recommendations for my beloved Costco to improve the crappy experiences I and many others have had with the food court.\n\nI also would like to say that I feel bad for the employees at the food court because it's a pressure cooker and I doubt it's an easy job dealing with the crowds of people that they serve all day. Thank you to all of you for serving us this yummy and great priced food!\n\nBut it's 2024 and I hope you do better and expect more from your employees and take time to assess and improve the efficiency at your food court.\n\nWill I stop going to Costco, heck no! But I will definitely continue to be a vocal customer if or when I get poor customer service. Just being real with you. Overall Costco gets a 8 out of 10 most days but today and in regards to the food court experiences today and in the past, they get a 3 out of 10 for customer service (but like I said earlier a 9 out of 10 for the food! Can't beat the quality and price!\n\nIf you read this entire review, thx. Very kind of you. \ud83d\ude0a",

(human invisible  cloth technique). Also, when they are discontinuing a product that you often buy, you are not given any warning. One day it's there the next time it's gone. Lastly, when you go online to see if a product is available for a store, for example, scoop away cat liter. What you see on that store's website is a different size & price. When I call, I get the excuse that online is different. Yeah, and my cat is a bully because that's how he expresses love. \ud83e\udd23  Overall, it's  a good store if you don't need help or need to look up an items availability. Employees ok.",

The store stands out for its impressive size, boasting one of the largest inventories in the area. This vast selection really shines through, offering everything from electronics to groceries, and their bulk purchases are a great way to save money.\n\nThe food court is another highlight, offering delicious and affordable options like hot dogs, pizza, and a variety of desserts that are perfect for a quick bite during a shopping trip.\n\nHowever, there's a slight downside \u2013 the parking. It can be a bit of a hassle, especially during peak hours. Navigating the parking lot can be challenging, but it's a small price to pay for the overall shopping experience.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the minor inconvenience with parking, the Pentagon City Costco remains one of my favorite locations. It's a fantastic place for anyone looking to find great deals on a wide range of products. Definitely worth a visit!",

      "text": "There are many good people here but Costco is changing rapidly and for the worst.\n\nQuality food:  recently I bought a package of chicken thighs (see pictures below).   In the past, each portion (small individual package) had 3 big thighs, and a random small piece, maybe 4 if smaller  I guess to meet the weightcriteria., .\n\nToday I cleaned and seasoned 3 individual packages (normally 10 thighs).  The pieces of chicken were so small that I had 22 pieces of chicken.  More than twice the normal amount.  After removing the skin, the skin, I weighted a few pieces and all of them were 2.6 oz.- 3.5 oz.  18 out 22 pieces were super small and 4 smaller than normal but kind of acceptable.   Imagine how small after cooked.\n\nThe other part of the poor quality control (chicken grade F) was so bad they put a piece of oddly cutted  leg was included in one of the small package.\n\nPlease start selling grade A chicken.  Mot this garbage.\n\n2a.  I went to Costco to return something I bought long time ago.  Oddly, the person could not fi d the item in the system.  Initially she told me she could not go X amount of years.  When I insisted indicating I have returned older stuff, she was able to go as far as necessary in my purchase history.\n\nShe still could not find any of the items.  I suggested to search by product manufacturer, brand or object key word.  She told me the system didn't had the capability.  She can only look by department number and check what I bought classified as part of the department.\n\nEventually she called a manager.  A guy named Llamar confessed that Costco was limiting the items of your purchasing history because people was abusing the warranty.\n\nI replied what that has to do with me?  The Costco contract with their members was 100% satisfaction warranty.  The only items with time limit are the electronics.  Just as a note, in the past I have returned items 10 months after the initial purchase because I didn't had the pressure of a standard warranty.  Even when I used to go to Costco twice a week.\n\nOf course this change of business model was not publicly announced to the Costco members.\n\n2b.  In similar fashion but more despicable, an old man (looked like late 60s or early 70s) was returning a Home Theather speaker system.  A kid already reviewed the components and gave the green light to the cashier to refund the money.  Suddenly a manager called Elmer arrived and questioned in a rude manner the old man.  The kid was ordered to take everything out humiliating the customer and eventually he agreed the item could be returned no before intimidating the young employee and the customer.\n\n3.  Years ago, the gas also used to be much cheaper than the competition.   $0.50 less per gallon easily.   I used to refuel twice a week due my long commute.  Until recently,  there was no difference in gas prices.  Now, Costco gas prices are competitive but not significantly cheaper.  Not even with the 2% of executive membership refund is enough to go lower than the competition.\n\n4.  In the past, I used get $80-$110 in rewards refund from my executive membership. With high prices, I stopped buying as much.  My last refund was just $25 because I started buying at other better priced grocery stores like Aldi's. I switched to a regular membership because it is no longer justifiable to keep the executive membership.\n\nCostco is behaving so cheap that almost look like Walmart. Many shopping carts need the casters replaced.  See the pictures showing the shopping carts that doesn't work because you have to struggle pushing it with the casters with no rubber or the rubber in the casters are falling apart. You are pushing the biggest shopping cart of all retailers, with over $400 in products, super heavy and it wobbles because they don't have the decency to replace the casters.",

Compared to the Costco closest to me (Gaithersburg, MD), I noticed some things in this Costco's favor. First, the store was noticeably bigger and perhaps thus less crowded. Larger selection of items as well, including a cat toy we recently bought on Amazon that we saw here for less than half the price. Second, there were a huge amount of free sample stations at around 3pm. Never seen that many at once at any other Costco. Finally, I noticed not as many people were leaving their carts in random places at diagonal angles, blocking traffic. For some reason I experience this all the time in the Gaithersburg one.",

It's about handling properly a busy spot like that. Lights never go green, he came outside on the phone, lights still green, gave me the papers and turned around. What you think? Yes, I played the truck horns!\n\"Hey! I'm in the phone!\" \"Sr, lights are green and I  ant depart till green, please do!\" \"Ok, I'll do.\" 15 minutes later I had to go inside just to find him still on the phone \"I'm working on that!\"  He shoot on me. When I came outside light was green, but guess what? I van driver blocked me having plenty space and a open dock to make his stop. The most annoying thing was that I called the receiving person (he had called with this # for me to dock) and explained him about the driver blocking area. He wasn't supporting, but negligent. Also, the area is a mess of cars, customers picking up flowers, by the receiving area, etc. Something can help his actitud is that drivers or customers don't care warning signs about that busy area (trucks entry etc).\nI hope to have a better luck when comeback. Date of delivery 11/28/2023 7am. Picks and videos below.\nTruckers entry: The entryway is by gas stations DO NOT use any other way. In addition, Possibly overnight (usually allowed in Costco stores) for early deliveries due to high traffic area). Good luck.",

Second pic is to provide reference for size, as I didn't have any tools to measure it at the moment.\n\nOverall, I'd rate it a 4/5. To preface, I prefer cookies with an undercooked, chewy interior (akin to one from Levain Bakery). The exterior was crunchy while the interior was soft. There was plenty of chocolate chips and surprisingly wasn't as sweet as expected (with the use of semi sweet chocolate chips).\n\nI'm curious how much a difference it makes; sitting under the heat lamp for 2 min vs 20 min. There were only a few left when mine was served; unsure as of how long it was sitting for. Would love to try again to get one that's fresh out of the oven for comparison.\n\nI'd definitely get it again; I'm sure it would pair well with the soft serve ice cream.",

The variety is excellent, catering to a wide range of needs and preferences.\n\nWhat enhanced my shopping experience even further was the excellent customer service. Our card was acting kind of weird, and the man at the self check out was super attentive and spent several minutes trying to help us out. He was generally super friendly as well.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the store was welcoming, with a well-maintained and organized layout that made shopping easy and enjoyable. The cleanliness of the store was also notable, contributing to a pleasant shopping environment. Additionally, the gas line up was not crazy which is a nice surprise.",

I don\u2019t think in the last 3-4 years that I\u2019ve been in Costco when it wasn\u2019t busy. Thats a testament to both the services/goods of Costco and the explosion of our population here in north Idaho. Second, and most importantly, today I had a young man who was incredibly helpful to me. I\u2019m disabled veteran but ambulatory except that I had surgery 4 weeks ago to repair my left pectoral muscle. I only have the use of one arm and asked to box my groceries. Without me asking the young man voluntarily asked if he could help me out with my cart and groceries.

Thank you Caleb for your faithfulness and cheerful demeanor.",

Unfortunately they had carts in between all of the other registers so we couldn\u2019t get through to grocery shop. I should also say the only reason I was going through was to help my 78-year-old mother get to the other side quicker, he yelled at me and said you have to go around through the front door, along with other rude statements. I tried to explain the situation but he was extremely arrogant. So my mom of 75 trying not to be disrespectful walked all the way out the exit then back through the front door which was a lot for my mother. We ended up getting her a driving cart. So if you ever have a return at Costco don\u2019t expect to go through the building to shop you will need to make the return, leave the store come then come back in the front door. \ud83d\ude14  with that being said we do love Costco. They have amazing deals on bulk food. The water is the reason we go it\u2019s under four dollars for an entire 40 pack or 42 pack.

It was no longer than 10 min.  Okay not that bad I could tell he was new and they gave him busy work.  Now for the big complaint.  I got gas and they have new pumps that don't allow topping off.  Updated Review.  They seemed to have fixed the sensitivity issue with the pump shutting off early.  So back to 5 stars.",

He is overly helpful each time and he earned them any amount of favour and these stars. Make him the manager!

I have since began shopping at the location much further away and I avoid dealing with anyone who works in the costco stores unless I absolutely have to.

Unfortunately, we were not aware that they close at 6pm but wthe staff let us in as we had 10 minutes to do the application. I forgot my ID in the car so I went to get it and one guy was in my face (his name is Tom) basically yelling at me to leave and talking over me. Not even letting me explain what was going on. Guy that was helping us at the desk had to tell him to let me back in. Man, I wish he put his hands on me and this store would be on the news again.\n\nDidn't really want to be a member here but had to, so we would be able to save money when we go to Hawaii in June as they only have Costco there. Thinking of  not renewing next year if they continue to treat customers like this. Would rather shop at Walmart, Aldi's, Shoprite and Wegmans and avoid getting verbally abused by workers there.",

      "text": "Clifton nj Costco stalker!!!!  Read on\nI\u2019m a new executive member and this will be my second time using my card. The first wasn\u2019t a pleasant experience because the man in the front stops you too look at your Card and didn\u2019t even let us explain we were there to pick up our card .\nBut the 2nd time was really something completely unnecessary. As we walked in, I got cleared because I showed my member ID I was with my mother and 3 children all which were sitting in the cart and 1 was walking with grandma . As I was in the  plates I notice a man looking at me and the kids between isles I wanted to confirm to see if he was following me and I went back and forth in my isle and he djd the same as I. I then kept my eye on the white older male from the plates all the way to the freezers in the back the man happened to be following me. My daughter noticed and began to cry because he was now pushing his eye contact by looking between the isles and literally copying every move I made so I decided to stand still and wait we were standing still for about 5min or more and the white older male didn\u2019t move . He then showed face and was on his phone I then felt so scared so many things happening with kidnapping children I thought the worst with this man. I called over manger that were on the floor and explained the situation. The tan manger saw the man and smiled at him like he knew him and female manger acted as if she was terrified and one other coworker that saw my daughter crying asked what was the matter I explained she went to look at the male and confirmed he was a UNDERCOVER SHOPPER ! a undercover shopper!! As I was waiting for the manger to clear the guy and return they instead stood by the man and never came to me to explain the issue . My mother then approached the white male and mangers! They lied to my mother and didn\u2019t want to reveal the undercover shopper . They didn\u2019t care about telling us the truth so that we can shop in peace. The Costco has so much protocols so much steps to leave that store they have one way in and one way out and everything you buy there is huge! I had 3 kids and a older women with me with the most smallest bags. My kids were under control I was admiring the store for the second time . Why were we a suspect the white male was going to continue doing that while I exit the store whyyy!!!! When we pay the check you and count everything . When we leave they check our receipts and count everything !!! Like was that needed . Costco needs to do a better job with this. They made us feel like we were criminals They made my daughter fear, thinking that this man was going to harm us! I couldn\u2019t shop in Pise and I couldn\u2019t buy my things. I left my things because again the managers never came to meet to explain what was going on only one of the coworkers.Waa kind of enough to explain who he was . I had to leave my things my children were afraid and they didn\u2019t understand the role of this man in the store. I pay for membership in doing all things right . I called the store and im  waiting for them to supposedly check the cameras . The lady on the phone playing her part and didn\u2019t want to confirm the man and redirect what I actually saw! I\u2019m so disappointed\n\nMy experience has been horrible here Please be aware of their undercover shoppers and always confirm who they are. The world isn\u2019t the same and we can\u2019t go by people stalking us throughout the store and give it a slap in the back and say it\u2019s OK because it\u2019s not OK we live in the world where people pray on children and pray on women, they need to respect that and they need to stop treating their goods like gold ! Again, Costco it\u2019s not OK you have all your security measures. You clear people in the front and you clear people when they pay and you clear people when they leave what else do you want leave the shoppers alone and seek out people that truly are stealing and if you suspected us stealing, then wait for me at the end, but don\u2019t follow me throughout the whole entire store.",

      "text": "This was my first time visiting this Costco, and boy, I told you it was so hard to locate anything and anyone. There's no sign to say what's down each isle. You just gotta figure it out. Which isn't helpful at all when you're trying to get in and out of a store. And finding help was even harder. The first person I saw I had to yell down a isle to get their attention for help. No, I didn't want to, but it was necessary in this situation. I was so over walking around for no reason. I did notice that they're offering flu shots in store. I wasn't interested but happy they had it available for the one that were. I also noticed they had 2 ppl on a register and a few lines closed, although it wasn't a long wait I didn't see the point of 2 ppl to a line when they could've just open other lines. But that is just my opinion and observations. The store was clean and well stocked and had things I didn't see in the union store. The saff was hard to locate until check out. I had a $1.50 hotdog after, and it was delicious. I can't go wrong with a Costco hotdog. The recipe checkers were extra on their job, we had different recipes and hr wouldn't allow us to leave until he saw both as if we did pay for or items or after we paid we walked back in to take something it was so wired and also nothing I am used to but I guess that was thought in training. If you're in a rush and need to locate something, try another location you'll be walking around for hrs trying to find it or someone to help.",

The warehouse store layout is well-organized, making it easy to navigate and find everything I need.

The starting yearly membership is $60 and the in store signup computer issues, staff error input and card printer not working are the only cons I experienced at Costco.  Costco offers larger/bulk quantities of items I would normally buy at a good price.  It does payoff as we saw many non perishables that we could buy in bulk - such as bottled water.  Overall this location seemed clean, well organized and had many good deals on items.  The staff at Costco was a bit robotic, meaning they do there job routinely without any being friendly.  I feel the $60 membership will eventually pay for itself when I purchase more items in a visit for BBQ\u2019s and non perishable items.",

Food from other stores has never presented an issue either.\nI still shop there because I haven\u2019t had an issue with the eggs spoiling yet; however, the organic brown eggs have been completely out of stock on my last few visits in the past 3 weeks at least.

      "text": "Costco has been our favorite store to shop for a while but NOT today. They do not mind to spend few minutes to collect donations for the cause of children which is great, but they said that they do mind drawing quick smilies on the receipt during the checkout at the exit as per new policy. When you take your young kids to the shopping and get lot of stuff, spend few dollars for donation at the cashier but cannot have smiles drawn in literally 3 seconds on the receipt anymore, seems to be the Costco Management problem. This issue should be fixed. Lately, customer service at this store has been poor. I think the management should hire more friendly and happy people or they ll see their customers going somewhere else.",

Returns also take less time than Edison .. there are also other shops around and they have their Costco gasoline \u26fd\ufe0f service .  Employees are very helpful and always smiling .. the only issue is - placement of items is totally different than other Costco locations . Ex - milk produce , fresh produce etc are in different places and we had to search for them . Otherwise it\u2019s a good experience overall",

You can discover an array of items ranging from various types of printers and computer cases (making you think you've stepped into Best Buy) to refrigerators, fireplaces, stoves, and washer-dryer sets. It's an excellent spot for young couples setting up their new home. Additionally, they offer car seats for infants and, in the fruit section, you can even find exotic choices like lychees and papaya. The entire store is spacious and well-lit, creating a very pleasant shopping experience.",

When I show my card at the entrance, why make me show you my card again before I pay at the self check out? When I do then you\u2019re like turn it coz I need the picture. Seriously why the audacity? Not even okay thank you. Secondly, some customers enter without showing their cards and it\u2019s okay but not on others. Thirdly, after I check out you make sure you count my staff which are arranged in order of the products and you can easily see the total if you know math like if I arrange in line each line having 4 items x 4 lines. Why count like 4 times yet you clearly see the total number of items on the receipt. I always forget to check your name but I will come back here to make sure I see your name and will send your cooperate an email to train you guys on how to be nice to customers.\nI am so sick of some staff who clearly just play with other people\u2019s businesses.

      "text": "This is one of the best designed Costcos around here. Huge parking lot, with easy parking. Huge and easy access shopping cart corral. Much larger walking space for shoppers getting into the store, larger main aisles and larger side aisles. Plus nothing blocking the cash register area, so the lines are much easier to manage compared with a traditional Costco where the cash register area is a mess filled with an extra row of food and snacks limiting and chocking the line of shoppers waiting to purchase to just 2 or 3 carts before the line has to bend in a huge mess.\n\nThe location itself is very convenient being next door to the Willowbrook mall, BJs and a movie theater.\n\nPrices are awesome for almost everything. If something is not on sale, just be patient and come back again another day.\n\nThe only negatives I have pertain to all Costcos and not just this location:\nNegative 1 are the Pantene shampoo and conditioner bottles used to be $9 per bottle until Bidenflation hit and now overnight the price jumped for no reason.. both are now $14 per bottle.. same stuff inside, same volume/quantity, same quality but price is $5 higher. Not made of gold or precious metals. Just greed. Luckily Costco realized the mess of this mistake and now often drops the price to $9 on sale usually once per month since at the $14 price not many people are buying it.\n\nNegative 2 is the Costco milk bottles. Years ago the bottles were identical to normal grocery store milk bottles. Then they redesigned the bottles to be a more square shape. The two problems with this new design are the safety seal and the pouring dynamics. The new safety seal is nearly impossible to remove without hurting yourself or using a knife or fork to stab it open and often I see these milk bottles with faulty seals that didn't totally seal or they sealed it in a way you can turn the cap all the way. Lots of defects and way worse than the traditional milk bottle seal. The pouring dynamics are also terrible. The new bottle shape makes it extremely difficult to pour the milk without spilling it all over the place. Really bad. Just bring back normal milk bottles please.\n\nNegative 3 is the Kirkland brand bottled water in the 40 bottle case. These bottles used to be slightly thicker and slightly bigger caps which made the bottles stronger and caps would perfectly seal no problem. Then around a year ago some idiot at Kirkland redesigned the bottle to have less plastic to save Costco money, but rendering the bottles and water inside useless. If you drop the case by accident, more than likely a bunch of the bottles will pop open and spill everywhere due to the weak and very thin plastic and very thin caps that pop off if you barely touch them. And if you even carry 1 bottle it is likely the cap will pop off just holding it. Please bring back normal bottles and caps for this. In the mean time I buy Poland Spring water since they use normal thick water bottles with strong caps.\n\nNegative 4 is Kirkland brand paper towels. Again in a stupid move to save money, Kirkland removed all the individual plastic wrap per roll of paper towels. So if you open the main seal holding all the rolls of paper towels, each roll can now easily get dirty from dust, spills, rain, snow, insects, dirt, falling on the floor, rolling in your car, falling on the ground outside.. there is now nothing to protect all the unused rolls. One of the most stupid ideas they ever had.. don't be fooled by them saying it is to save plastic. It is for them to save money and charge us full price while making all your unused paper towels in storage much easier to get dirty becoming useless and then forcing you to go back to Costco and buy more rolls sooner. So I buy Bounty towels instead since they are logical and still have individually wrapped rolls to protect your unused towel rolls that are in storage.",

They bring in a lot of cute and cheaper things for the holidays. The selection for the whole store overall is very good as well. If you are looking to buy cheaper and in a bulk this is a great store to go to. They do have a food court as well. A lot of people stop here for a quick bite or a snack. You can also get a water bottle from their vending machines for only .25 cents. If you need something cold to drink. The store is always clean but very busy during the day and on the weekends. The lines move fast and they do have a self checkout area as well while moved quickly. This store is very nice and big with plenty of parking. I would recommend not going during the busy times so you have time to really see what they have.",

Someone in your store needs to buy a 2.5 pound bag of coffee and try to grind it in your store.  Its a joke.  Both places there are no scissors and no one knows where to find them.  Problem 2, your grinder only fits half the bag of coffee.  What exactly are you supposed to do with the rest of the beans if they won't all fit into the grinder?  Last there is only one grinder.  Please do better.",

They were all their vanilla flavor with cheesecake mousse inside. They had all our cakes available by the specific date & time we indicated and we were able to easily pick them up - and they were a HUGE hit! It was such yummy cake, according to many of our guests :)\n\nWe also purchased all of the alcohol for our wedding here, and it was great to be able to return the unopened units after we got back from our honeymoon and settled in again (within 60 days of purchase). They were a great deal, and we don't drink but our guests loved all the options!",

Anything from fresh produce, organic too along with the regular selection. Be advised to buy here it is best to have a pantry and a freezer of decent size. I have a small chest freezer in the garage for the overflow from the fridge/freezer in the kitchen There are tires, household goods, electrical appliances, and sometimes flooring. Clothing and shoes are always stocked. Much more as well. The membership rates have 3 different levels I use the one that gives a store voucher every year which pays for the membership with a little left over for shopping. It is probably worth a 5 star rating, but the prices of some of the things like meat, and a few other things are still market price with no savings. They do have specials on occasion. Gas at the pumps is always the best price in the area. 10 to 30 cent cheaper per gallon.",

She comes across incredibly disrespectful, loud and curt with how she talks to people and was literally shaking her head and rolling her eyes when I returned about $30 worth of merchandise today.  No it was not a dead Xmas tree or a half eaten cooked salmon.  It was some unopened beer and cider and brownie brittle.  I spend over $10,000 of merchandise per year at Costco and returning a few items here and there is not against the policy.  I\u2019m not sure why she is so rude but she\u2019s the last person people they see when they leave the store and it leaves a lasting impression of her attitude towards customers when they are treated so poorly.  Sadly, it makes me not want to return to this Costco due to the multiple bad experiences and due to the fact I can\u2019t avoid seeing her.

There was a price tag above, but I didn't see any in a box. I took a picture of a chair price tag. The cashier at the self checkout looked up the merchandise code and had someone bring one to me from their inventory.  They loaded it into my vehicle.",

It's a relaxing place to shop, at least for us.\n\nWe grocery shop here at least once a week, sometimes more. There is always a good variety of just about everything you would need. Not just food either. The gluten free and vegetarian options are slowly growing and we appreciate it.\n\nThe bakery is always a good go-to for a birthday cake (that buttercream filling!) and their pumpkin pies are insane.\n\nThe deli has saved the day for dinner on more than one occasion. The taco kits and rotisserie chicken are our favorites.\n\nWe also love that we can buy good quality affordable clothes here. They don't jack up the price like everyone else does.",

That being said, employees need diversity training as most hourly workers are from isolated and culturally insular local communities. Costco may not have the proper training protocol nor the professional resources to create change. Most corporations are on the same boat. Starbucks was under scrutiny in this respect. Sustainability of a company is largely based on how well you treat all customers, not just those who belong to your own ethnic group.  This could be a good challenge for Costco to take on as a trail blazer in corporate America. Corporations can set an amazing example by making their sales/profitability success a cultural success for the better community.",

Over the years I've been consistently amazed with the return policy, no one else even comes close.   Prices are excellent on most items, but like every store, you can find better bargains on some items elsewhere, but its not by much.    Merchandise is typically of higher quality than elsewhere.  You need to consider that when comparing with other stores.   BTW, check out the COST stock.  Its been amazing performance, and I would recommend it as a long term investment.   Yes, they are cracking down on the membership thing.  I find it annoying too, but I understand its because that's their business plan.   The vast majority of Costco profit is in membership, not in the product itself, which they sell at razer thin margins.    Our family easily gets the annual membership fee and much more back from the 2% annual reward.    They have avoided raising the membership fee, although I suspect its coming, as well as scanning the membership card when you enter the store.",

      "text": "I just started shopping here the last month and I know what you\u2019re gonna say. You\u2019re an average, so you get what you get in Everett. However, the staff has been amazing with the exception of this evening, when I made the very rarely, but still happens mistake of bringing my service dog with me. There were at least three other service dogs in the building and they try to trick you upon walking in, as if people with service dogs don\u2019t know that we can have them when and if we feel the need to have them where we need them. Anyways, my service dog as an emotional support service dog and is trained in anxiety in addition to my husband\u2019s heart condition. That said, one of the cashiers came up to us and politely asked if she could say hello now I see why many people with service dogs prefer to not allow people to pet their dogs. This woman was extremely kind, and  truly grateful to be in the presence of my dog. And as we left, my dog responded to our baby talk with one bark, we said goodbye and as I walk out the managers seem to feel it necessary to stop me. Ask me if I\u2019m OK and let me know that dogs only bark service dogs only bark when you\u2019re going to have an episode. He was clearly  passive aggressively trying to challenge my condition or my dog, seeing me giggling and laughing and smiling and waving goodbye knowing I was not in any kind of distress, but just felt the need to go out of his way to make me feel a certain kind of way. It takes a special kind of person to have , this regard toward dogs anyone really. And I\u2019ve only come across it a handful of times through years of having a service animal. Hopefully as time goes on, I\u2019ll be able to update this review because the rest of the staff seemed extremely kind, warm, and even fun to banter with the several times I\u2019ve shopped here so far. I just don\u2019t understand what compose a person to take time out of their life to go and negatively impact somebody else\u2019s day  I guess I will never understand that.",

But if you view them in that perspective I would say you could strike an excellent shopping balance. For example, I grill with charcoal alot and I normally wait for the sale to get the Kingsford Professional Charcoal bags. But I miss the sale more than I catch it. However, I just recently noticed the Business Costco stocks them more often than the regular Costco. Also, there is more of a variety of larger bulk items that may be used continuously; such as chopped salad or coffee for those mass meetings or luncheons. The mood at this business store in Fife is alot different than what you'll experience at the store in Tacoma. It can give off an unfriendly and uninviting vibe by the staff. But when observing those who shop here they are extremely focused on what they're getting. So, I didn't notice much engagement because everyone is in and out with blazing speed! But it's not an excuse for subpar customer service.  I observed and experienced it from a few of the employees and they could demonstrate just a tad of professionalism at the exit door and the checkout lines.",

There is NO OVERNIGHT PARKING according to the signs so plan accordingly.\nUPDATE: So I went to speak with the manager (David) and explained that I had a 4am delivery and asked if it was ok to stay overnight, he very nicely told me yes and that he had no problem as long as I could move from where I was currently parked. I also appreciate Stacy who was at the door and was very helpful and said she\u2019d be doing security until about 11pm and thanked me for asking and letting them know.

      "text": "I\u2019ve been shopping at Costco for a very long time, this review is more about Costco in general not just Lake Stevens. Back in the day Costco used to be about quality products, yes buying bulk saves money but you could always count on getting a high quality product. These days I\u2019m not sure we save much money and the quality on most products are not good at all and is you start looking at where their products come from it\u2019s mainly from China. I know it\u2019s hard to not get anything from there but I was shocked to see how much food products are from China. Yes it\u2019s cheaper but they have almost no regulations so you don\u2019t know what kind of low level poison you are ingesting. Another thing is that I used to go to Costco almost weekly because the produce was so good, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because ok Stevens is not as busy as other locations but the produce has been sub standard for a long time now. I get much better quality at the grocery store and because I\u2019m not throwing a bunch away I am saving by not buying from Costco anymore. Lastly you have always had to show your card at checkout and someone checks you\u2019re product as you leave. My last visit was a tough one, I had to wait to get in because they were checking cards, had to wait to check out now there is a long line to get out because they are checking every single item, I snapped at the gal checking products and grabbed by receipt from her which was rude and wrong on on my part so I apologize for that. I called and talked to the manager and apologized and asked why they they were checking every item instead of a quick scan.he pretty much blamed it on the checkers and it helps them save on shrink. Well it is actually the checkers instead of making your customers feel like criminals and making us stand in line to get out of there why don\u2019t you install cameras and watch the check out process. It would save us all a lot of grief!!",

I spent over $300, only to be told at the exit that the items at the bottom of my cart were not scanned or paid for because they couldn't find them on my receipt. The employee called for help to check my order, but nothing was found. Meanwhile, other customers with bigger carts were hardly being checked, simply because they were not of color.\nI became frustrated as they continued to go back and forth, claiming something was missing but not being able to figure out what. It didn't make sense to me, especially since there was no self-checkout and everything seemed to be in order. When I asked for my order to be canceled, the employees completely ignored my request and continued to rescan all my items.\nFeeling fed up, I decided to walk away and reiterated my request to cancel my order. Despite nothing being missed in the end, one of the employees was told to bring the items to me as I was leaving the store. I am deeply disappointed and upset at how they treated me like a thief, selectively discriminating against me even when nothing was found.

I asked him if they could credit me back and they said yeah because you purchased it within 30 days we will happily Give you a refund to the amount of the discount so that way you don\u2019t feel bad about the purchase so that was a really good experience for me. I really liked it. Happy to continue being a Costco customer. The people here are quite nice.

On busy days it can be a long and frustrating time to either find a spot or just to make your way to an exit to leave.\n\nThe one advantage this Costco provides is they have a reasonably priced car wash. Even when the line to get a car wash looks long and daunting, the line generally moves quite fast and the wait time isn't too bad. It's been since I purchased gas from this location (I go to the Federal Way location where their gas price is significantly less expensive), be aware of the yes or no questions at the pump as you may inadvertently buy a car wash that you didn't intend to. I am so used to answering yes to 'printed receipt?' that I didn't even realize there was a car wash question.\n\nAs far as the store itself, it's mostly like all the other Costco locations though it seems like it's a slightly smaller location so there may be some items they don't carry. This location is also subject to the Seattle sugar tax so prices on soda and other sugar sweetened items end up ridiculously expensive.",

As Bob Barker used to say \" the price is RIGHT\"  Then the rest of the stuff in the store; delicious bakery items, deli items, love the chicken salad and  fresh baked croissants! Sometimes there is close outs on food items really great prices  . Also tires and car batteries, home electronics really BIG screen t.v.s too bad nothing worth watching but great prices on Giant screens!  Lots of Apple stuff tablets, watches, laptops if you are a fan boy or girl. Personally I love android all the way. Love this place, been a member since 92' oops dating myself.

The shoppers sometimes appear to lack common courtesy. Despite that, the store offers a wide range of quality products. However, I had an unusual experience with a staff member at the entrance. When I briefly examined some clothing items, an employee abruptly interrupted her tasks and asked about the size I needed in a somewhat impolite manner. This was unexpected, as I've never encountered such a situation at any other Costco.",

I buy lots of meats then vacuum seal and freeze them. And then dried and jarred goods I also take advantage of. And now to the important part. The food court!!!

I have quite a few things in my wardrobe from here that I wouldn't buy anywhere else, even if I could. Most of my camisoles that I wear daily were bought here, along with the plain white t-shirts my husband wears under all of his clothes. Plus they are carrying a pretty good selection of Legos sets this year during the holidays and this dope af StarWars pinball machine that has 10 different virtual boards programmed into one compact, authentic looking machine. That is for sure at the top of my Christmas list this year! \ud83d\ude09\ud83c\udf84\ud83c\udf81\ud83c\udf84",

I did not have any problems with the groceries, and I really like how everything is nice and fresh, especially the produce, meats, and the like. I went to the store mainly because I wanted to look for a burner gas grill for some reason. I was really not going to buy it and I was just trying to check it out to see if it is available here and also if the prices are good. I was really glad how the staff helped me when I asked for it, like where it is located inside, the price, and the things about the particular burner gas grill I liked to check. After thinking and knowing the price, I ended up buying it since it is reasonable and it really seems like a great choice considering its quality and everything. It was not my intention to really buy it, but thanks to the staff who helped me, I realized that it was a great deal. I like their customer service. I did not forget to buy gas, and their prices are definitely better than anywhere I could ever think of.",

However, a short-haired Karen just yelled at us today, saying some membership stuff and not letting us use self-checkout two orders. I know it\u2019s a new policy, and they try to enforce it back. But there is no reason that Karen needs to yell at us. I can\u2019t believe I spent 120 dollars on membership each year just being yelled at. I also had bad experiences with this Karen before, she wasn\u2019t happy with the basic requests. I understand if you have a bad day or something, but it\u2019s not a single incident. Really disappointed. Ruined the whole experience. However, most workers there are very nice. Just not that Karen.",

Now, I'm sure that food servers are supposed to have a food Handlers card of some sort but she disregarded the safety of other by blowing into those holders. It is even in the food and sanitization exam that you should NEVER blow into gloves or any sort of \"cooking paper\" to separate it.

Christmas plants, toys, decorations and many new items were being perused by the shoppers.  The store was crowded yet orderly, especially in the checkout lanes. My wife had misplaced her membership card and without missing a beat, a new card was created which earned  a broad smile from her.  As per usual, our tab at checkout was more than intended.  We find that this the norm as we discovered items we knew came in for,  yet there were so many other \u201ctempting buys\u201d that somehow made it into our cart.  The tire store had texted us that the vehicle was ready long before we were finished with finding out what was new or interesting to us. Costco is premier shopping outlet that we enjoy visiting.

I repeatedly stated I just wanted the basic membership.  He would not back off on trying to up sell me. I have never been pressured so hard in my life. Far worse than dealing with any car dealer, lol. He kept telling me I have nothing to lose. I flat out told him I'm losing my patience.

He took time to go above and beyond to help me.\n\nI went in this afternoon to purchase a set of tires. I had no idea where to find any information pertaining to buying them, so he actually walked to my car to check the measurements etc.\n\nAfter we found the correct tires and price, I mentioned that I was worried about the time it would take for them to arrive since I needed to drive 400 miles for work within the next few days. Carlos went back out to look at my tires and explained that it would be dangerous for me to drive such a distance. He also had this verified by his supervisor.  Thanks to him, I quickly rented a car and avoided a potentially dangerous scenario where my tires could have blown out.\n\nThank you Carlos for taking the time to help. As someone who doesn\u2019t know much about cars, I appreciated this help. I hope the Costco team recognizes the great work he is doing",

I did have an experience there over the weekend which I would like to relate: I couldn't find my Costco membership card (it was in my car,) and while I was going through my credit cards, a staff member came over to assist. It was very kind of him to offer to let me use his card (I'm not sure how that would have worked.) Fortunately, I had a Costco cash card on me and used that instead. So what's the problem? I discovered later that another card of mine was missing. I don't know if I dropped it there for sure. I would just like to request that your gas station attendants not hover over customers while they are going through their credit cards or wallets. It's very easy to get distracted and drop something inadvertently. I like to have time to check the pavement around me. Thank you!",

During the weekends, the hustle and bustle are expected, with crowds bustling through the aisles. However, it\u2019s the weekdays that truly shine for me.\n\nOn a typical weekday, the store transforms into a tranquil haven, where one can shop at a leisurely pace without the pressure of navigating through a sea of carts. The calm atmosphere allows for a more thoughtful shopping experience, whether I\u2019m browsing the latest electronics or restocking the pantry.\n\nWhat keeps me anchored to this Costco, apart from the wide selection of products, is the unbeatable\u00a0gas prices. Consistently offering the best rates in the area, it\u2019s become my go-to spot for fueling up my vehicle, adding to the overall value of my membership.\n\nIn essence, Costco Pleasant Prairie has become more than just a store; it\u2019s a part of my weekly routine that I look forward to. It\u2019s where efficiency meets serenity, and where every visit feels like a well-orchestrated shopping adventure.",

Usually I always meet very friendly and polite service staff. They always smile and ask if I need help.  I usually like self-checkout, but today because there were too many people queuing up at self-checkout, the service staff suggested that I switch to staff checkout service.  Unfortunately, I was not so lucky this time. I met a very rude checkout person, ROTTANAK. He asked me expressionlessly, do you only have these items?  Then every time he completed a project, he would throw away my products rudely, which made me feel very bad.  Later, I stood nearby and watched for a long time. When dealing with white customers, he always wore a smile, checked out gently, and would not rudely throw away their goods.  All I can say is that I encountered discrimination because I am Asian?  I really can\u2019t believe it. After living in the United States for many years, this is the first time I have had a very uncomfortable shopping experience.",

      "text": "Love Costco ever since they first opened their stores in Chicago IL. For a big family as big as 4+ people, the store has good durable household & food products worth the value compared to other retailers.\n\nI mainly like about the store the fact that they almost always sell the same items you have accustomed to buying at this place. Lately though, allot of my favorite products either discounted or temporary unavailable, for whatever reason few of which are: bacon wrapped chicken cutlets which went MIA since last year. Also haven\u2019t seen the $100 smoked prosciutto meat leg. It used to come around winter season & made an excellent gift, but I haven\u2019t seen it this winter. Occasionally I also see some out of stock favorites but they return after 2 weeks give or take.\n\nCostco has mainly Kirkland brand as their supplier as well as other big verity of organic non GMO products. Though there still a few bioengineered stuff seen in the back of the contents label.\n\nI like the fact that they promote their products to taste them out prior buying. And truth be told 95% of the stuff I tried as sampler I ended up buying and it was good. So I\u2019m glad they have the samplers because had I not tried it myself or someone recommended, I would have never purchased it out of blue.\n\nParking at this location is always packed, no matter the day or the hour. But I calculated best time to shop at Costco is after 3, during weekday, between Mon-Thur. Less people at the store & close open parking spots.\n\nBut in order to shop at their store you need a membership card. Otherwise they won\u2019t allow you to make a purchase. Unless maybe if you have a guest pass. Not sure about that. But what I\u2019m sure of 150% is that membership has to be 1 per (2 people) household. So for example there are 2 membership cards for household, say one in your name another for a spouse. Yet if your mom/dad/sibling wishes to visit the store without any of you, your household family members will not be able to shop/buy if their name isn\u2019t on that card. They recently changed their policy about that. :(\n\nWe have a large family, brothers & sisters all under one big roof. Been buying at Costco for years, our household main person is my older brother. So it was his & his wife names on the cards. We never had issues cuz all of us are with the same last name/address. Once or twice they asked for ID to check home address but not since October 2023. We used to be able to shop there without an issue until they strictly enforced the other people of the household to pay for the annual membership. I think it\u2019s super unfair to enforce that rule and they will only loos money on that whole membership issue which is $60/year (the lowest). Imagine how much $ people spend daily\u2026 I can reassure you some members of my family refused to shop this place because they enforced their membership. Anyway it\u2019s their loss. But what I have been told of recently, they are planning to get rid of physical cards & scan membership from smartphones.",

I don't know what happened now. Sometimes they spray the cards with some chemicals but newer wipe them. Is this chemicals safe for my skin? I don't know. Now is even worse. Store which charge me over $100 per year complitely doesn't care! I was there on May 25th 2020 around 1:30PM. Beautiful weather, no cards at all! All cards outside! Nobody cares! I spoke with the manager which was really nice and he can't see everything so the problem is: there is no team. Someone should inform the manager about the problem before I did it. Aldi stores don't charge any annual charges but they have a person who cleans the cards and takes care of them. It was my last year with you guys. I will quit.\nEdit: Costco Tire Center Service: you guys better start to sell donats not tires! I had appointment to fix the tire, I came 15 minutes early and still wait 2 hours to fix the tire!!!!!!! What a shame!!!!!!",

The pizza dough is runny, half the condiments are almost always out, and finally they can barely fill up my coffee cup. I am amazed at how rude they are when you tell them to fill up the cup for something you paid for! It's not coming out of your paycheck!\n\nAlso, the cashier \"conductors\" are super loud, rude & obnoxious. Yelling at members isn't constructive ushering, their job is useless. Surely, other places in the busy store need help! This is consistently happening so I am not wasting my money here anymore. I am canceling my membership because of this.

I was behind them and the line was close to one of those podium the staff like to stand by and watch the store. The special needs customer was having free samples and kept asking his mom repeatedly if there was a trash can. If you\u2019ve been to this Costco you\u2019d notice they\u2019re everywhere really. He then kept saying \u201cMom I found it.\u201d and was so happy to throw away his trash. He clapped and kept saying \u201cYay!\u201d. There were a couple of employees standing at and by the podium. An employee said \u201cAre you serious? There\u2019s a trash can behind them..\u201d The employee was upset because the special needs customer used the little trash can next to the podium instead of the larger trash can that was farther away by an isle. The employees surrounding the area were also conducting themselves in a demeaning manner. One said \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him!\u201d Another said \u201cIgnorance is bliss.\u201d and started laughing. Mind you the customer they were talking about aloud was special needs and probably didn\u2019t notice their belittling, unprofessional, disrespectful, degrading remarks where directed to him. The mother seemed bothered by it though. I really felt sorry for her because she was just there to shop and didn\u2019t go to Costco to have the employees criticize her son. He was just throwing away his trash properly and not tossing it on the ground. I don\u2019t understand why a group of employees would even be bothered by it. He\u2019s not creating more work for them or interrupting there workload. The employees were just standing around doing nothing. I\u2019m going to cancel my membership. The customer service is  just lacking at Costco. They have good deals but it\u2019s not worth supporting employees who have such condescending behavior toward their customers.",

He looked at me and the glasses and decided that was good enough. The glasses did not sit properly for the bifocal portion of the lenses and the nose pads were never adjusted. Subsequently, a nose pad fell off and I had to pay another optomitrist to replace both so they matched. I made extra effort to use Costco for glasses but NO MORE! Terrible experience.

Attitude dropped to hell and she was so rude addressing us that I couldn\u2019t pay with my debit card and I\u2019d have to pull out cash. I apologized as I didn\u2019t know this was a rule as I don\u2019t regularly shop at Costco.\n\nShe continued to explain with a tone that my mother should have known. Then she didn\u2019t scan my mother\u2019s items as tax exempt and when I asked she got even more angry with us and stated we should have told her ahead of time as now she has to scan everything again, my mom got 10 items. Again, I don\u2019t go to Costco and my mother never had to ask before, it use to be automatically done as she has a business card.\n\nNot sure if Rochelle\u2019s just mad as it\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day and she has to work, but please just be nice to the customers. We didn\u2019t force you to work today, I just wanted to help my mom buy stuff.",

They pointed up to a rail and said something while turned around to assure me that they didn't. 15 minutes later I asked about it again and they said that they lost it.

      "text": "Our family absolutely loves coming to Costco. We frequent here on the weekends mostly, so we aren't exactly seasoned on what the store is like throughout a standard Monday through Friday weekday. But on weekends there are usually samples of various food items throughout the store. This gives us a chance to try a bit of everything. For example, the kids tried lentils for the first time ever. I could almost guarantee that if I made them at home, they wouldn't even give them a try. But, because they are samples, the kids tried them and loved them. Now I can make them at home.\n\nThe biggest draw, however, is the hot food deli. You can't beat their pizza and their $1.50 hot dog and soda combo. On weekends prepare to wait a while as there can be a substantial crowd waiting on food.\n\nAlso, I believe Costco only accepts visa as digital payment. So if you have mastercard or American Express, you might have an issue. Cash of course is always accepted.",

      "text": "This place is a h3ll no for me. My boys had the bright idea to get a Costco Membership today. We were immediately stopped upon entering the store even though the two people in front of us weren't stopped. After my experience in the store today I'm going to attribute it to the fact that I hadn't gotten a fresh blowout this morning nor do I shop at J. Crew or Macy's.\nWe went to the desk to get a standard Membership because we just wanted to check the place out. HOW DARE WE ONLY WANT THE STANDARD MEMBERSHIP!!! We were met by Lisa, whom was extremely aggressive and got angry that I had researched the memberships ahead of time and knew what I wanted. She was not about to hear it. Her attitude was so nasty I wanted to just leave, but my boys really wanted to check it out. So she got the same attitude she was giving from me.\nThis place IS NOT for people with anxiety or PTSD.  Don't expect to be able to browse. If you want a rotisserie chicken you're waiting in a line for half an hour if not more.\nIt's just too much here. Noone needs this much food unless you have a family of 12 or more. That's the only way I'd find this place worth it.\nIt's also the hot spot to take your family of 13 for lunch. Trying to go down an asile while mom and her wild children are standing in line for a sample is ridiculous.  Technically this is a playground with snacks....\nEven the employees have had it here. Everyone of the employees given out samples were exasperated.  Pretty sure the last one I saw was contemplating his life choices and the life was drained from him when a mom in plaid and her puffer vest pulled up with her 4 young children whom were bouncing and screaming as the employee tried to prepare the children's free lunch for the day.\nThe Membership is ridiculous.  2 cards? Only two people can share the membership in a household??? And someone in your home can't use your card....You HAVE to be there and YOU have to pay for your items.\nBeing watched like a hawk while my son was checking out is scary.\nFelt like I was being accused of stealing the way my sons items were gone through as we left.\nConstantly having to show our membership card.\nIt was too much. I was ready to throw hands with anyone just trying to leave.\nI'll be canceling the membership.  Not worth anyone's mental health here.\nAnd who needs a chicken potpie this dang big?!?!?",

      "text": "Costco is an absolute gem of a store that never fails to impress me. From its vast array of high-quality products to its exceptional customer service, it truly stands out as a shopping haven. One of the highlights for me is their gasoline service. Not only do they consistently offer competitive prices, but the convenience of filling up while doing my regular shopping is a game-changer.\n\nWalking through the store, I am always amazed by the variety and value Costco provides. The bulk packaging is not only cost-effective but also eco-friendly, reducing unnecessary waste. The fresh produce section boasts a wide selection of fruits and vegetables that are consistently fresh and delicious. Their Kirkland Signature brand is a testament to their commitment to delivering superior quality at an affordable price.\n\nThe friendly and helpful staff members add to the positive experience. Navigating the store is a breeze, and their willingness to assist makes every visit a pleasure. Plus, the samples offered throughout the store provide a delightful treat and a chance to try new products.\n\nBut let's not forget about the membership perks! The gas prices alone make the membership fee worthwhile. It's incredibly convenient to fuel up at the end of a shopping trip, and the savings quickly add up over time.\n\nIn conclusion, Costco's commitment to excellence shines through in every aspect of their operation. With unbeatable gasoline prices, a vast selection of top-notch products, and outstanding customer service, Costco has earned my enthusiastic recommendation. It's more than a store \u2013 it's a shopping experience that keeps me coming back for more.",

I know people didn't love the hassle of the parking lot remodel last year, but it speaks to the company to repave before the lot was in major need of an overhaul.  This Costco has numerous employees who have been here since it opened which is a testament to the company and local management too.  Even when it's packed, it's great to shop at a place where the employees from all departments seem to enjoy where they work.  Staff from the tire shop had jumped onto the registers the other day and they were wonderful too.  Thank you!",

That said, it is refreshing to have a retailer that is so convenient even when you are away from home.  Our most recent stop was for fuel and a quick bite to eat before getting on the road.\n\nIn addition, my wife and I have also started tracking how many different Costco locations our two month old has visited, six so far.\n\nIf asked, I always recommend checking out Costco for your needs.  I can't imagine they don't have something for everyone.",

Sam\u2019s club layout is a lot better thanCostco. Costco seems to have their items scattered around instead of grouping certain items together. Sam\u2019s Club has their candy,snacks and chips all  in a tight section where you can go up and down about four isle and can find everything in that section if those are the items you\u2019re looking for while Costco very small section that isn\u2019t even straight. The selections are not as big and honestly the prices seem better at Sam\u2019s. I don\u2019t like that that we get in the self checkout and workers still come over and scan some item before you\u2019re done. Is there is a scanner at the check out that I can use myself, then why would I need a person to scan for me? Now the scanner he used was in his hand and I had one in my hand so who is my items being scanned by someone holding the scanner other than mine? It sounds like it\u2019s part of the security system but it contradicts the meaning of \u201cself checkout \u201c. There is a bottle neck around the rotisserie chicken area that people who\u2019s not looking to buy one has to contend with. I saw one isle of men clothes but four for ladies. The workers are very nice but I\u2019ll stick to Sam\u2019s club after Costco membership expires.",

      "text": "Lots of variety at costco. If u pay for a membership to shop, this is the preferred place. The Executive level is $120 but it allows you to get 2% of your annual purchase back in a certificate to use or cash out. Costco has become part of the American way. From blackberries to bundt cakes, they have you covered. Today , 9/1/23 I went to Costco again for odds n ends. They didn't have those so I got other things lol. Blackberries, izze lemonade (both on sale). Oh n Hershey syrup,  2 bottles for $4.97 since it's discontinued perhaps. Same price as izze above. Must be deleted for good. Oddly they do not allow members to order food court items at the front end registers ANYMORE. Can not do it at self checkout either. I say bad move because ordering it before you end shopping, having to order at computers at food court, delays rhe time for you to complete your shopping experience. Who would change policy at that building and not at one at nesconset? I actually laughed instinctually when a red vested employees told me.",

The service is subpar and usually it begins with an attitude. Not just towards me, but other members based on my observation. One employee is really nice and helpful (Frank). He took the time to correct the errors made by the previous employee that decided to walk away for his lunch break, mid transaction. The employee that walked away, told me that the car batteries are pro rated over a year\u2019s time and said o needed to pay $75 for my battery exchange. The battery was only 8 months old and sells for $110. After the confusion I realized the $65 was the cost of membership renewal (which I told him to include in this transaction since I had to renew). I\u2019ve seen him working at this location for years now. How could he not know what he\u2019s ringing up? That\u2019s very concerning especially since he\u2019s handling money for this place. Also, walk away mid transaction for lunch break? I hope corporate reads these reviews. Based on recent experiences it seems like no one cares at all over Costco corporate or even at the warehouse.

When Suzanne the cashier helper said it\u2019s your responsibility to get the receipt from the cashier.  I\u2019m sorry Suzanne if I rang myself up yes it would be my responsibility to make sure I received a receipt . However I did not ring myself up you and another gentleman did. Wouldn\u2019t it be your responsibility to hand a customer a receipt when you ring them up? I\u2019m sorry it isn\u2019t rocket science.

I started scanning all the little stuffs , I had couple of large items like water case and cereal boxes on the shopping cart, I asked Brenda to help me scan the rest item, she refused to help me she said no I told you everything will not fit. I told her I have never place water cases on the register, it usually gets scanned on the shopping cart. I also told her if she is not willing to scan to give me the hand scanner so I can do it,. She just turned back and left. She just abandoned her post. I paid to shop at Costco, I get treated with disrespect. Asked for the store manager, some other employee claiming to be a manager, named sherryl, tells me that I should have listened to her in the first place. I have been shopping there with a payed membership, went through the self checkout. With way more merchandise, I was helped before, and not to mentioned they scaned other costumers merchandise from there shopping cart, and they gave me an attitude in front of my five year old daughter. Trying to play me like a fool. Your employees were unprofessional, and didn't want to provide service when requested and tried to brush me off because the I was pushing a load that may been to much for them.i put up a picture of the shopping cart they refuse to scan by hand.",

With a narrow sidewalk leading to the store to keep you safe from moving vehicles. Store is rarely overwhelmingly crowded, is usually kept very neat, clean & orderly. As are their bathrooms. Eyeglasses are about one third the price of anywhere else I have had the misfortune of purchasing them over the last 40 years. Checkout is always quick; I usually use the self-checkout area. Nice place to shop.\nAlso: ten months after purchasing my glasses I returned to inquire if anything could be done about a chip in one lense. Unsure how it happened. The gentlemen told me it would be a week to ten days. No charge!!!!!",

This one has really good parking and a funny floor layout that involves two floors escalators and elevators. Sometimes the wheels don't auto lock so you can take the escalator so then you have the use the elevator which can only take about five carts at once. Either way is slow compared to their flat layout. I personally rather fight for parking and be able to move my large, heavy shopping cart around the entire store easily.",

According to tradition, we ordered a whole pizza, drinks, ice cream from the cafe and waited about an hour for something else. There was a young man serving, he was the only man on shift, the rest were girls. He gave me everything except pizza within an hour. although I stood and all this time asked him to give it to me while the pizza was being prepared. he publicly ignored my request and took advantage of the fact that I don\u2019t know English well. continued to serve all the numbers that came after me. In addition, he took my personal check with which I stood in line. in the end, an hour later I gave everything except the pizza, then crumpled up my receipt and threw it on the table. I was perplexed and outraged by this behavior. I asked to invite a senior employee. but the employee ignored my request. my husband came up and asked where our pizza was, to which he said that I allegedly said that I got it. my husband said that this is impossible because I only speak Russian. the employee did this to justify why he crumpled my check. in the end he went and gave the pizza. I suffered humiliation and discrimination from this employee. I was under a lot of stress. If I see this employee again, I will never buy anything from him and will advise my acquaintances, relatives and friends to do the same. .I am attaching to this review the receipt that he crumpled up and threw on my table.",

You have to be willing to buy in quantity (such as a 1.3 gal bottle of Heinz White Vinegar at a very low price), and sometimes an item you like (eg. the cinnamon rolls and Paisley Farms 4-bean salad) will disappear from stock only to reappear 6 months later. While shopping, take advantage of the free samples handed out by their friendly staff. You need to pay a yearly membership fee to shop at Costco's which also entitles you to purchase gasoline at their pumps at a price that is usually the lowest in town. Be sure to sign up to receive their monthly mailer listing items on sale. UPDATE-1: The 24 pack of cookies at under $10 is a bargain. The chocolate chip and macadamia/white chocolate cookies are very good, and the oatmeal raisin are outstanding.",

It was fine when it was just the cash registers upfront.\n\nMy biggest complaint and maybe I don\u2019t know the whole story, were the managers standing around yelling at the busy employees, pretending to help but making everything stressful and chaotic.

He was saying \u201cwhy don\u2019t you sit don\u2019t, calm don\u2019t, see all better?\u201d Meanwhile the employee he was talking to ignored him. Managers HELP them, you useless a-holes.",

So I thought I should go online even before my family has collected all the items we need because usually in Brooklyn the line takes forever but overhear I went to the line and I was almost done checking out even before my family has finished collecting all the stuff they needed they check you out very fast even on a Sunday but add the receipt check at the end of the store that took a while even though I had so little items she made sure everything was counted but that didn't bother me so much, it's a clean and nice store bathrooms were clean and nice not smelling like in Brooklyn. I like this location also you have phone service all over the store. Whomever you ask any worker in the store will answer you right away wherever store items are you won't have to go too far to look for them",

I\u2019ve never been disappointed by a product.\n\nThey have a an excellent electronics section. Their TV selection has a great variety of makes and models. They have the best policy on headphones and ear buds - LIFETIME SATISFACTION GUARANTEE (if you don\u2019t believe me talk to someone in the store or look online).\n\nAs a whole the warehouse carries a diverse selection of items. They continue to get new products and do a nice job rotating them throughout the store .\n\nIf you\u2019re a first timer, just get one of the rotisserie chickens. I promise it\u2019s not all hype, they\u2019re great.\n\nMy most recent purchase has been a Lasko space heater. Couldn\u2019t be happier. The heater is efficient at warming up any regular sized room in a house or office. It has all the bells whistles and more for only $50. More importantly it\u2019s very quiet.\n\nThey usually have the cheapest fuel in town. If you play the membership/credit card game right you\u2019re able to earn lots of cash back.\n\nLAST THING: COSTCO - Bring back the turkey melt!!!",

The first time it was expired fresh fish. The second time it's smoked salmon, it's in a vacuum package and it's already five days overdue. For me, it's terrible how it happens in a store where I pay for membership. That is, I have to pay for it and not receive proper service at the same time. I understand that I can go to the store and get a refund without any problems, but no one takes into account my time spent on this, I live 30 minutes from the store and in order for me to get a refund, I have to spend an hour! Also, since expired products are often found, the desire to go to this store begins to disappear! It can also happen something terrible and someone, without noticing it, will eat expired food and get to the hospital! Does it also mean that I have to go around the store and check the expiration date of each product? But it seems to me that this is the work of the store's employees! We like this store, but we regularly come across expired products and you're already starting to wonder if it's worth going there!",

We bought a down comforter yesterday and when we unpacked it at home that evening it was immediately apparent that it was heavily used and returned and put back on the shelf to resell without even looking at it. It was covered in stains (looks like sweat or urine, possibly blood?), hair, and other debris which would have been obvious if even a bare minimum inspection happened. When we returned it today we were refunded but the employee told us they don\u2019t look at returned goods and just take the persons word that it was unused. This completely changed my opinion of buying any consumer goods from them. It was essentially a biohazard and now I\u2019m concerned about fleas or bedbugs or any other possible infestation that could be in our home. Very disappointed in our experience which seems very out of character for an otherwise great store. I guess just be aware of this possibility when buying home goods from here.",

You can buy most things here including food items, soda, diapers, dog food, clothing, electronics, alcohol, bakery and much more. It also has a gas station with the lowest prices in town!

They renewed my next membership for only 10 months at full price, instead of 12 months, and the people at the service desk actually refused to answer straightforward questions about this, and just redirected to \"we can refund your membership if you never want to shop here again.\"  The problem is I do find it a useful store to shop at, and would like to be treated fairly while shopping there.  Twice I've gone out of my way to make sure I paid the correct amount at a register when a Costco employee made a mistake and missed an item, but they won't do the same when the mistake works in their favor.

Went to split the payment in line separating hers from mine and was told the member has to pay or I can pay cash. Over 150$. Does anyone carry that much cash on them??\n\nThe rude cashier then states it\u2019s been a rule guests must pay cash and I mention I was not aware. She says there\u2019s are signs everywhere then I ask if she can make an exception this time since this is the first I\u2019ve heard of the rule.\n\nShe calls manager over who also gives me a hard time I explain that I\u2019ve come to this Costco many times with my a member and split payment and they say those employees weren\u2019t doing their jobs. He then says \u201cwell it seems like we\u2019ve made exceptions for you in the past\u201d where I respond: \u201cit\u2019s not an exception if I didn\u2019t know it was a rule in the first place\u201d after about 5 mins of back and fourth and him not budging  I was finally like \u201cok are you guys going to put all the stuff back? Or make an exception?\u201d As a little check mate and he said \u201cok let it through\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t understand why Cash vs Debit matters?? Most businesses prefer cards. Only heard of cash preferred for the companies looking to be under the table or tax evasion. Maybe trying to save on processing fees.\n\nMake this \u201cRule\u201d well known somehow!!!",

All the staff were very efficient and helpful.\nThere are a few differences from the West Des Moines location:\n1. Optical is to the far left by pharmacy\n2. Alcohol is in the back left corner area\n3. The back is similar but bigger, pet stuff is tucked in its own section in the back\n4. There is a fridge section next to the freezer section with cheese, meats, etc.\n5. Food court has a nice self-service. It\u2019s super easy, just hit buttons, pay and then wait to pick it up!\n6. Tire shop is a little further back on the left (from entrance).\nHope this helps!",

There were 3 workers at the doors (1 checking costco cards as you enter, 2 checking receipts as you leave - which amounts to them staring at your cart for 10 seconds pretending to compare it to the receipt, then drawing a line on your receipt with a highlighter).\n\nAt the front of the store there were 2 more workers (managers?) standing around a podium. Finally there were 2 workers at the register. The lines were absurd as most of the registers were closed. Of the 7 people working at the front of the store only 2 were on a register actually helping customers.\n\nAgain this was a Thursday evening, if you go here on weekends be prepared for the situation to be even worse. The management here does not care how long the lines are, their reply when I complained about it to them was \"I wouldn't come in on the weekends\".",

The store can be busy at times and the parking can be hectic.\n\nWhat annoys me the most about this location is the customers are so rude. They just stand in the way, never move their carts, hardly look both ways when walking, and almost run you over. The aisles are narrow which makes the store congested. The parking lot is just as bad, people not looking both ways and cutting through.\n\nThe gas lines can also be long. When pumps are free they don't move up.",

No signage, just rolling racks of flowers.\nWe stood in a check-out line that reached the meat section, only to find out we needed a third pot of flowers, to purchase the two we had. The woman ringing us up and the man helping her, both rude AS HELL! I was told that I shouldn't have unloaded my cart on the belt, b/c now they'd have to lift items more than 15lbs. OMG REALLY?!? I WAS TRYING TO HELP!\nThis was a reminder to me on how Sam's still has you beat on some of the simple things... Curbside pick-up, line control, and now employee attitudes.",

Store supervisors Natalie and Katy P. recently helped resolve a purchasing issue for me, displaying a dedication to customer satisfaction and brand loyalty that is remarkable. They were willing to make decisions that were fair to the customer and responsible towards the company, even when an assistant manager seemed hesitant, indecisive, and willing to lose a sale and disappoint a member. This should reflect in future promotional opportunities. With years of sales, customer service, and team management in my background, I\u2019d hire them both for management hands down! Nothing bothers me more than poor customer service, and these fantastic team members prevented me from looking elsewhere for this product, and possibly membership.\n\nLanny at the loading dock is also a rockstar and deserves a shout out.

      "text": "This is for the Greensboro location.\n\nParking is busy, but the packing is ample. And the usual Costco size parking spots make it easy to park, even if you have a truck.  They don't help pull the shopping carts up to make it easy to grab a shopping cart. Also, the door doesn't greet you with the Southern warmth that you would expect.  Oddly, they have a walk-up eye test window that I've never seen anywhere.  The food court is indoors in front of the check-out lines, so it makes it tough to get by when people are waiting for their food.\n\nMy worst experience in a Costco food court was here.  They push you to use the kiosk to order your food even though there wasn't a line.  The counter was not friendly. They failed to even engage at all with people and only would be friendly to select people --- and we were not those people.  This was not an management issue but an employee issue.\n\nThe store was not crowded, and the lines moved pretty quickly. The selection was good, but the layout was oddly narrow and didn't flow as well as other Costcos in the same area. No employees working in Electronics or Jewelry or any of the major high-profile areas which was surprising on a pre-holiday Friday afternoon.\n\nSelf-checkout was not friendly either.  They even questioned if I was the person in the photo! I'm pretty sure I'm not an underage person trying use their parents Costco card.\n\nI would honestly drive 15-minutes more to the other Costco location.\n\nMidas 2-stars for the unfriendly service.",

That said if you buy more than you need you then run the risk of wasting. Occasionally you may also find that some other stores have sales etc where you can buy less quantity with the same overall savings. So being informed is the key.\nNonetheless Costco has great deals! Great rotisserie chicken, pizza, hot dogs and more.\nIn my humble opinion if you can shop here regularly the membership cost is well worth it!",

This hides the fact that it's no cheaper than other places.\n\nMost of the workers were decent. Still have the usual rude ones. I didn't hold back at this location like the other.\n\nIt's an okay place to do what needs to be done. But paying $120 for a membership to a place that's has the same prices done higher, not much lower than a normal grocery store. Well, I'm not sure about all this, lol.\n\nGo check it out. Just really look at the prices. I'm guessing this is why they are scared to let you go in and walk around before you get that membership.",

      "text": "We came here while traveling from Canada.  We used Costco self-checkout for the first time and for the last time trust me, as it kept glitching.  The lady helping had to help us at least 4 times and basically checked everything out for us.  We got to the door and the girl counted every single item.  A skirt had been missed.   We spent over $350 and a skirt was missed and we were held at the head of the line making everyone else wait and listening to her yelling for someone to come over.  I wondered do they go through your cart and count every single item when you shop and you have a human cashier?  I wanted the skort so we paid for it.  But I went out into our RV and got a shirt I bought two days before after spending over $450 at another Costco.  It had picks on it and I had forgotten to take it to return it.  It was only $6.99 and figured I\u2019d just keep it for wearing around the house.  After this episode I was was so upset and felt like everyone looked at us like thieves so I stomped out and got the shirt and got my money back.  The manager matched my degree of upset instead of trying to appreciate how I was made to feel.  He said he wouldn\u2019t be steamrolled or treated like dirt.  I was upset but I didn\u2019t yell or swear, I was indignant.  I said you don\u2019t mind letting your employees treat your customers like thieves though do you?  He walked away.  I want to gather all the things we\u2019ve bought from Costco on our trip and return them to his store.  But I won\u2019t\u2026.i will ask anyone on here?  When you go to Costco and a person runs your groceries through, do they pick up and count Every item in your cart?  I will Never use self checkout again.  And like I said, the lady there helped us 4 times.  What a rotten way to be made to feel\u2026.",

EVERYTHING we compared was more money than even Publix and Harris Teeter AND that before the $60 annual membership and the fact you have to buy BULK everything which only goes to waste or you need to invest even more in food storage. Everything from toilet paper to pies to rib steaks to powdered drink mixes. All more money per unit than higher quality grocery stores. Not to mention that stuff that can be found a Walmart, like toilet paper - total ripoff. And to top it off I could only use Visa or debit card AND the member advisor tried to sell us on the idea that \"99% of all members have a Gold membership\" - LIE. And to top it off, no aisles were labeled and it was so crowded on a Tuesday morning 10 minutes after opening you couldn't even move with a cart in the store and browse leisurely.",

      "text": "My wife and I signed up for a membership with the hope that all the claims about buying in bulk were true. Well, for some things you may save money, but on most of the items you don't. For example, we compared their prices of toilet paper, paper towels, pasta, milk, produce, soda, dishwasher detergent and laundry detergent to prices at Walmart. In most cases, the unit prices were the same. In some cases Walmart was several cents cheaper and in other cases Costco was several cents cheaper. Now, for the non grocery items such as books, clothing, shoes, kitchen, and electronics, we found their prices to be higher than what you would pay for these items on Amazon. My wife and I made the decision to cancel our membership within a week. It was not worth the $40 membership fee to essentially break even. I recognize they have their own credit card that you can get 4% back on. Well, American Express has a no annual fee card (for the first year) where you get 6% back at all grocery stores and 3% back at all gas stations. Amazon has a chase card where you get 5-6% back on everything you buy. Plus, I am not going to mess with the huge crowds, waiting in line to have someone examine my receipt with a microscope, and trying to find parking without getting hit. Not to mention waiting in line at the gas pumps. I know some people spend time here because they enjoy simply going. For me, time is money. If I can save money and time elsewhere why in the world would I shop here?",

However, Cameron was extremely kind enough to not only double check the inventory/computer system to confirm.   But he was also gracious enough to take the time to thoroughly explain how some specialty food items are a regional thing.  And he understood how important this food topic was to me\u2026\u2026 Considering I\u2019d be driving roughly 40 minutes one way just to come get this delicious Korean meat!\nIn my opinion, Cameron went above and beyond my customer service expectations\u2026.. And I believe that is the best definition of excellent customer service!!",

They fail to ask whether I need a box or act as if my asking for one is inconvenient\n- Tiresome explaining I have a truck. Small items are free to move around the bed of my truck.\n- More than a couple times I didn\u2019t say something in time and ended up with no boxes to help manage smaller items. Very frustrating especially when dealing with items in glass containers!\n2. Aggressive and inconsistent scanning of items by staff at self-checkout.\n- Evidently, they do this to mitigate splitting orders? A friend was told this. They will randomly pick random items to scan, not just big items but small things like muffins or chicken. I\u2019ve caught myself re-scanning items they already pre-scanned which would mean I\u2019d be charged twice.I question whether I\u2019ve re-scanned without catching myself?! It goes beyond courteous and is clearly contrived \u201cassistance\u201d. I have the higher tier membership and it\u2019s very off putting having them disrupt my shopping experience with this ham-handing mitigation.\n3. They seem to have backed off this one a little but for a time they were aggressively asking for a picture ID. Again, I pay for the higher tier membership. It\u2019s off putting being subjected to the show me your papers bit.\n4. General rudeness. It\u2019s strange but there is a general smug attitude at times from some staff. Like they are doing me a favor letting me shop at their store. A moment that comes to mind is when I had a full paid-for cart and my children and I were getting food at the food court. An employee was standing by the end of one of the tables and I asked whether I could leave my cart beside the table while I ordered. Not really sure what other options there even are?! The gal was indignant and told me I can\u2019t leave my cart there. I'd be blocking traffic. I asked where I\u2019m supposed to put the cart and she just looked at me with an upset stare that I would even ask. I ended up moving my car back behind a closed down till. It was too far for comfort from our table but I did my best to keep an eye on it.\n\nAll of this said, I do love the store and there are a lot of courteous staff. That said there are noticeable examples of poorly executed management initiatives and a clear lack of courtesy from some staff that may demonstrate courtesy isn\u2019t a high priority for some management.",

I like that they often have new items; but the flip side is you might not find your favorite items coz it's been replaced by new items. I really like that they listen to feedbacks and order items in for you to purchase. The rotisserie chicken is pretty good, but Sam's Clubs has better tasting ones. Cafeteria is always open, but the selection of soft drinks not so great. Sam's has at least 3 times more choices in fountain drinks but not always open...\n\nI appreciate this Costco a lot. Long live the West Fargo Costco! \ud83e\udd1f",

      "text": "I enjoy going to Costco.  I do think the membership is worth it if you are selective on what you get.  Example would be the cost of Charmin Toilet paper or the large box of small bags of potato chips.  There is a large difference in price for what you would pay at the normal box stores.  Recently I purchased a Green Works self propelled electric mower.  Never would I believe I would buy one, but the truth is, that todays gas mowers are not very good or worth the money.  This 80V, 21 inch self propelled mower with batteries included and charger were bought for $499.  The charge is enough to do my yard and it really does an excellent job.  I can't believe that I actually liked it.  It is quiet and cuts well. Only thing wrong I've found is you need to let go of the self propel and let it travel a couple of inches for the wheels to roll backward without locking up.  My only complaint so far.  I do worry that the batteries hold up, but only time will tell on that. I do recommend this product.",

This was the first time I had tires installed by Costco Tire department and I was amazed at how quickly the install took. I was pulled in at 4:28 and by 4:57 I was out the door. On Saturday, I took my van to have an alignment done on the wheels and the mechanic on duty told me that two lug nuts were completely loose and that all of the lug nuts needed to be tightened the rest of the way. This is frustrating because what if I had not gone to get the alignment done and rode around on loose lug nuts? Perhaps slow down on the install and make sure everything is right the first time. Now everytime I have to bring my van in to have the tires rotated am I gonna have to have someone else check to make sure the lug nuts are tightened correctly? I am needing tires for my other vehicle in the next year, but am hesitant to buy another set from Costco if they are not going to pay attention and do the job correctly.",

      "text": "I honestly think the only reason this place stays in business is because it only has one real competitor. For the most part, Sam\u2019s Club is leagues above Costco for a multitude of reasons. First, I don\u2019t understand the need for employees constantly asking to see your membership. Last time I went in, I was asked by 4 different employees for my membership over a span of half an hour. One of the times was while I was at the self checkout. That one didn\u2019t even make sense because I can\u2019t access the self checkout without scanning my membership to begin with, so what was the point? The only thing positive I can say about this place is that they do have very good protein-friendly foods. From quick microwave-able options, to different cuts of meat, to protein snacks & shakes. However, most of these items sell out quickly and either don\u2019t restock for a month or don\u2019t restock at all. The app is also pretty useless too, since it doesn\u2019t tell you where any items are located in the store or if it\u2019s in-stock at all. Lastly, and I know this one is a bit of a nitpick, but the people who shop here are the absolute worst. I have never seen such a lack of spatial awareness and common sense in my entire life. People will run into you with their carts & block out aisles, then look at you as if you are the problem. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to count that against Costco as a company, but I believe it is worth noting. I think your best bet would be to cancel that Costco membership and go to Sam\u2019s club.",

Lots of Summer items out from furniture to plants, a nice variety and selection of both. Nice selection of fresh-cut and in vases for Mother's Day, or just to give somebody some lovely flowers.\n\nApril 2023; the staff is always super friendly and helpful. Enjoy shopping here. Always love their whole roasted chicken and always a great deal, $5! Nice selection of fresh produce as well. Found an oversized and sturdy welcome mat for $11. Also love the samples, gives you an idea what you can do for dinner (try before you buy). The plants and trees are in excellent condition and worthy of any yard.\n\nMarch; Nice store, first time at this location. Always top off my tank at the fuel center, and today tried their infamous hot dog and soda for $1.50 - very good! Clean and neat store, helpful associates, check out was a breeze with friendly staff there as well.\nLike that you find most anything here, in bulk, but also a tire center, eye glass center, pharmacy, planting and outdoor needs as well.",

      "text": "I first joined Costco when we decided to get a dog. It sounded cost effective even though were are a family of two.\n\nSeven years later, we lost our dog, but we kept our Membership. Even though we don't go there often, the do have some of the best deal and unbelievable, customer focused policy.\n\nLast year, my husband had a full knee replacement and his friend recommended that we get a recliner from Costco which helps people to stand up (the way it's designed). So, of course, it sounded like a good idea. My husband was on a mission to take his PT and knee exercises seriously because he loves playing golf more than anything in the world. I saw him sitting on the recliner less than 10 x in the year since we bought it.\n\nLast November, I called Costco to see if I could return this ginormous recliner (it had been just over a year). Ironically, my husband had bounced back and was on his annual golf trip. The lady in customer service said if I brought it into the store, they would take it back. She assured me it was fine and to make sure the to bring any electronics associated with the chair.\n\nTwo weeks later, my husband and I took the chair back to Costco (with trepidation) because it didn't sound believable that we could actually return it for a full refund.\n\nI rolled the recliner chair in a big, flat cart and took it to customer service. The person scanned my card and gave me a full refund.\n\nI was elated!! I was happy to get the money back, but even happier to get rid of another piece of furniture which was taking up too much space!!\n\nThank you, Costco!!",

First instance was when I asked my daughter to pay with the credit card with my name on it that I was handing to her IN FRONT OF THE CASHIER which matches my membership card because I really had to use the bathroom. This woman had an absolute fit about it and was super nasty to me bc 'she's not on the membership card'. She was extremely rude about the entire thing. Now fast forward about a month and a half and I didn't realize I had this cashier again. I'm checking out with my husband and I asked him to go order a pizza while we were checking out so it would be ready by the time I was done. He hand me his card just in case I cannot find mine. The cashier IMMEDIATELY snaps at me and says 'are you on the membership too?!', which I tell her yes I was and that was my husband. I then told her I was looking for my card but I though I might have forgot my card at the return counter when we walked in. Apparently this was not okay with her because she starts berating me telling me I cannot pay for the groceries with my credit card because he walked away and I didn't show her my card even though I AM ON THE MEMBERSHIP and she watched my husband walk away to order the pizza. The way she goes about this entire thing is why I'm so irritated about it. She caught me off guard with how mean and rude she is. She's vile and doesn't know how to speak to people. I could use other choice words to describe her but I won't be doing so.\nSomeone needs to have a talk with this woman or I will be letting my membership expire if I have to deal with this again.",

Today I went to Costco, picked out my items and then looked and all the line were back to the meat case. After literally waiting 10 minutes with the line barely moving I left my cart. This is not Super Bowl weekend, Memorial, Labor Day or any other special weekend. Why would a store manager at noon on Friday, ever let the store get that much out of control. It would have been different if all of the registers were open, but they were not. When a manager first starts to see the line getting past a predetermined point, additional individuals should be called up to run a register until the lines begin to clear.  Costco, what gives???",

We finally found it after he pulled another pallet out.  Then we went for the Lego ones and again he pulled another pallet out.  He didn't just walk away.  I assumed once he pulled boxes off he just say you didn't have it but the kid definitely went above and beyond patiently going through the boxes to help us.  Cashier was also quick and kind.   We're from out of state and seeing you hold up to great customer service I'm thankful.   Again, if you would, give Christopher some praise.  He made y'all look great.  I thank him!",

      "text": "I have had a Costco membership for over 20 years. Until this store, it has been my favorite place to shop. Not just for food, but for clothes, shoes, kitchen things, electronics and so much more. I loved taking my time and seeing what was new from my last visit and I was never disappointed. Recently my previous store closed and a new one opened in West Chester. I HATE IT. It is so crowded all the time! No more spending time in the aisles perusing deals and new items - it\u2019s too crowded. Half the time I can\u2019t even get to the aisles. Specific items have been out of stock - something that I\u2019ve never seen in other Costcos. The checkout lines are complete madness. I\u2019ve spoken to some of the employees who have come from the old store. I won\u2019t go into details, but their stress levels are very high. Don\u2019t even get me started about the parking. I\u2019ve parked closer at a Browns game. I\u2019m very sad. Feel like I\u2019ve lost a friend. I\u2019ve been driving to Florence, KY when I need to make a trip now. I used to just go because it was such a great place to shop and linger. I think they could have kept both stores open and had no loss of foot traffic. I\u2019ve talked with other Costco shoppers. We all don\u2019t like this store. Too much traffic in it. Yuck. I miss you Costco.",

I asked for the manager and I explained the situation to Manager Troy and how it was wrong to change the price tag and claim I was wrong. Troy acted like he did not understand with the most stupid/fool face. I explained him twice but he continued to play idiot. It was really annoying and unacceptable. Costco manager should own the mistake, apologize, and honor the customer. Troy acted like he did not understand, did not apologize and ran from the checkout area to avoid confrontation.

One thing to keep in mind is that (almost) everything comes in bulk, so be prepared to stock up! Also, don't forget to bring your own bags, as they don't provide them. But overall, the savings and selection make it well worth it. I've saved so much money on groceries, household items, and more. The warehouse can be overwhelming at first, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be hooked! Great experience and highly recommend!",

      "text": "Walked up to the automotive counter and no other customers were around. Talked with the Costco person at the counter about getting a refund for the core battery I had brought back. Phone then rings at the counter and the Costco person answers it and now I am waiting. Eventually I walk away from the counter with the core battery. I definitely understand if the Costco person was on the phone when I walked up but this was just a lack of customer service the way it was handled by Costco. Option #1 could have been to not answer the phone until I completed the return. Option #2 could have been answering the phone and asking that customer to hold while the return was completed. Customer service is fading fast at Costco. All that will be left soon at Costco is pricing and once that is not appealing it will just become another big box store. Sad because it had been a great store for so long.\n\nEdit: I returned to the same Costco to take the core battery back again and the same person was at the automotive counter. He (Steve) asked to scan the QR code to show the membership at Costco I had and I held the phone up. He then asked if he can take my phone. I asked if he scanned the QR code and he said he wasn't able to at the counter. I told him I was not going to provide him my phone and then he demand the account number which I provided. He gathered all the details of the car I have and then went to get a new battery off the shelf. I explained that I was returning the core battery that I had brought back to the counter. He said there was no record of a battery purchase. I then asked about the core battery for my wife's car battery which I had recently bought at Costco also. He again gathered all the details of the car and went to get a new battery off the shelf. I again explained that I was returning the core battery and was just looking for either of the two batteries I had purchased so the core battery could be returned. He said there was no record of that battery purchase either. I then asked to speak to the manager and he came over to the counter. He (James) scanned the QR code and located both battery purchases and provided a refund for the core battery I had brought back.",
